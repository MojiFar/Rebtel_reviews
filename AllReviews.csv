In a subsequent Online Chat with them I was asked for a SUPPORT TICKET #, which was NOT SENT TO ME!Eventually, I was refunded $ 10, which is far short of what I expected (i.e. 100% refund).  A TOLL FREE number costs Rebtel NOTHING, and yet they are happy to charge 50 TIMES a normal call charge for this.A further online complaint to them did not generate a SUPPORT TICKET # either, and I have still not received a refund, as requested.I am so unhappy with Rebtel that I will most likely move to another provider when my credit is depleted.",2018-03-15,10:03:29

121,Nola,1,Watch out for unauthorized charges!!,"I recently had a bad experience with Rebtel. I was charged $7.90 for allegedly ordering 50 minutes to United Arab Emirates. I did not make that purchase. Moreover, I have never had reason to call that country or buy minutes for UAE. Therefore, I called my bank to dispute the transaction. When I complained to Rebtel, they ‚Äúrestricted‚Äù my account and demanded that I cancel the dispute and accept the (unauthorized) charge. Really? The bottom line is I will no longer use their services. There are so many free alternatives: WhatsApp, Skype, Facebook Messenger, Googlechat and so on and so forth. I‚Äôm hoping they give me a refund for any unused minutes. Unfortunately, I cannot check to see if I have unused minutes because they have blocked my account. What a way to approach customer service!! Just shut the customer up?! Ridiculous. First I got a message from Rebtel agreeing to the refund of $7.90. Then I got the following message (which is an exact copy of theirs): ‚ÄúYour account was locked due to a payment dispute. The payment you made with your Visa ending on - - - - on 2018-01-26 20:37:37 is currently under dispute, which means that you or the cardholder reported the payment as unauthorized.A common cause for reversed payments is insufficient funds or payment fraud so the locking of the account is measured we take to protect the owner of the Used credit card.To unlock your Rebtel account, we kindly suggest you cancel these disputes and please also provide us with a written confirmation of your bank of the canceled disputes and saying that you recognize that payment and accept the charge.‚ÄùUPDATE: Below is Rebtel‚Äôs response to my request for reimbursement for unused minutes. I wrote it after their comment below. I still have not received the reimbursement and I cannot access Rebtel to figure out what that amount is!  Just lovely! ‚ÄúThanks for getting in touch! We are still in the timeframe, please allow 3-5 business days to reflect the amount in your account that we have refunded. Have a great day!Best Regards,RyanCustomer Team‚Äù",2018-02-23,16:15:38

I was absolutely wrong to trust that statement.My phone is not working since 24-Oct-17. I have written to them like every second day but of no use. No replies. No follow up and unfortunately for Rebtel I had to come here to give my negative rating. No one is bothered at all in this company to communicate with customer. After I reported the problem Rebtel wrote to me only once sending me questionnaire and I replied on all those questions and after that there was no reply at all even though I wrote to them when it would start working again? I think probably Rebtel could not solve it. Rebtel withdrew the money from my account and within couple of days all the local numbers stopped working.

385,Rebtel User,1,Worst service for the price you pay - El peor servicio por el precio que exigen.,"I entered a star because that was the lowest option for the rate, but Rebtel deserves pretty much none.Rebtel customer service is the worst ever. I don't blame the employees as the company is close to bankruptcy they get paid pretty low based on the quality of the services ""they claim they provide"".Also in case that the users dont know it. Rebtel will automatically block your account if you are using any type of VPN or IP address changer, which is not against of any regulation or agreement between service provider and client. They will claim is for security measures but the truth is that they sell your browsing history, your calls patterns and location, the frequency, in brief, they profit your online activity like any other crock site claiming they are protecting your account by default violating your privacy rights.To corroborate this, I bet I will receive a faster response from Rebtel team apologizing on this platform than them actually contacting me for the claim I still waiting for on the Rebtel website.Spanish:La clasificacion mas baja que esta plataforma  permite es una estrella, pero Rebtel no merece realmente ninguna. Estrella negativa calificaria mejor esta compania.El servicio al cliente de Rebtel es el peor de todos.

Su argumento por esta accion es por medidas de seguridad segun comunican los empleados de Rebtel, pero la verdad es que ""VENDEN SU HISTORIAL DE NAVEGACION"", sus patrones de llamadas y su ubicaci√≥n, la frecuencia de las mismas, en resumen, monetizan de su actividad en l√≠nea como cualquier otro sitio nada trasparente y corrupto, alegando que est√°n protegiendo su cuenta mientras violan los derechos de privacidad de los usuarios.Para corroborar esto, apuesto a que recibir√© una respuesta m√°s r√°pida del equipo de Rebtel ""disculpandose por los inconvenientes en esta plataforma, en lugar de contactarme por el reclamo que todav√≠a estoy esperando en el sitio web de Rebtel y del bloqueo de mi cuenta por razones que no han podido o no quieren exponer.",2017-10-25,10:59:22

Since I'm out of the country now, I wanted to use her account to make cheap calls to the U.S. It seems like you can't do this though, so I went to the site to make my account and chose the option to call the U.S. free. Now, AT&T notified me my bill would be $537, and when I said i don't use my phone the calls they were seeing are through Rebtel so it means they're not doin their job. Luckily, it was rerated to $150, but I feel bad as my mom shouldn't have to pay that when the only calls I make are through the app, claiming my calls are free. I've even seen in my call history calls I never made to Maine, for example. What is that? I can't even find a customer service number. Would be better if my mom and I could share an account, or to have them pay this bill for bad service and see how to fix this so I can use them in the future again.

428,....,1,FAKE unlimited calling- BAD customer service,"Thanks to Trustpilot for provding a platform to exchange with and inform others.For Rebtel:  I'm not even going to dignify your ignorant answer below with a reply, as it would be an insult to my intelligence. For others:Following up on my 1star (if I could I'd give no star) review, seeing that Rebtel Custome Service responds to 'public' reviews on sites like these, rather than through their customer support line.First to my issue for contacting them (FAKE unlimited calling!!!). I can see why some people on Trustpilot think their customer service is a machine responding and not a real person. I clearly stated that my UNLIMITED CALLING plan says  'UNITED STATES UNLIMITED': call ANY NUMBER in  the United States AS MUCH AS YOU WANT, both landline and mobile' and even sent them a screen shot of that!!!! But they just send the same answer over and over again. HEY REBTEL IF YOU DON'T KNOW ENGLISH DON'T USE IT!!! U N L I M I T E D MEANS NO that's - NO RESTRICTIONS -!!!!. If you're as sophisticated a service as you claim to be - newsflash - it's 2 0 1 7 find a way to weed out your commercial scammers with  2 0 1 7 technology. Second: I've taken the time to read reviews - or rather mostly 1 star ratings - about Rebtel on this site. SAME COMPLAINTS OVER AND OVER GOING SEVERAL YEARS BACK!!!! A N D SAME INCOMPETENT ANSWERS OVER AND OVER!!!!They clearly have several disclosure issues but on their website they claim'Legal informationHere at Rebtel we‚Äôre committed to managing our business in a transparent and ethical way. We promise to always be upfront with our customers about how our business works (and especially what it costs)'. In 2013 Rebtel reported revenue of $95 million (source: Wikipedia), which can't be that hard to reach if you don't disclose to your customers...I won't go into even more details - AS IT IS THEIR JOB NOT MINE to read customer reviews and MAKE CHANGES ACCORDINGLY. From the time I've spent reading complaints there are SEVERAL ISSUES (that KEEP COMING UP!!) THEY SHOULD ADDRESS, to retain customers and their satisfaction.Rebtel should also keep in mind - that for every customer that takes the time and effort to file a complaint - there is a huge percentage out there that doesn't and just leaves and let's all their friends know HOW BAD REBTEL IS!! I very rarely write reviews and my last one here was approx. 2013 - and it was positve (and waaayyyy shorter).To sum up Rebtel1) They don't disclose properly on several issues2) When contacted -if they answer- it is inadequate, bordering on stupid3) They are more likely to respond if you give them a bad review on a 'public' site (although they quite often claim they can't find your info, tix#, etc.)4) The issues are not likely to get resolved (see also  point 2 above)5) Conclusion -> why stay with Rebtel, when they don't provide what they say they do, don't seem to care about their customer's satisfaction and DON'T FIX THE PROBLEMS THEY CAUSE!!6) It's 2017 there are plenty other providers out there.... ======================================================My original review:NO unlimited calling - as their deal said! BAD customer service!I have the same problems as many other reviewers. I bought the unlimited calling to the USA which reads 'United States Unlimited, call any number in the United States as much as you want, both landline and mobile'.However, yesterday I tried to make a call and got a message that I could only call 30 unique numbers during my billing period, and that unlimited was not for commercial calling!?I emailed support and heard back- basically the same thing I got from the phone message when I tried to make the call the night before. I replied, that I am making private calls, but that I'm abroad right now and need to stay in touch w/ people for important things, including the hurricanes that are currently ravaging.I also included a screen shot of my 'so called unlimited deal!'. Still haven't heard back!!I appreciate that they want keep commercial callers out - but they have to come up w/ something much better than just cutting off customers unexpectedly.I've started to look around for other services -even though I've been w/ Rebtel for many years.

510,Atni Davis,4,Problem solved!,"I started Rebtel with the ""try it free for 1 week"" with subscription for Indonesia unlimited - I've made a couple of calls to Indonesia and they were great. On the last day of that 1 week free trial, when I tried to make a call, I got the message saying,""Your account balance is too low..."" so without knowing the app very well I  accidentally put $10 on the world credit. I emailed the ""help"" at Rebtel and I got a reply which was basically saying that they can't refund my world credit and they are basically using whichever credit with the closest valid date (I honestly didn't really understand it, but I let it go). The next day when my 1 week free trial is up, I paid the $10 monthly subscription for Indonesia Unlimited (6/29/2017) and I can also see that my world credit balance has kept going down as I made calls to Indonesia (which I thought it was supposed to be covered by the monthly subscription). Today (7/7/17) with ACTIVE Indonesia unlimited account (renewed in 23 days) and $6.14 in my World Credits - I placed a call to Indonesia and guess what? I got this message again: ""Your account balance is too low..."" Uuumm...can anyone give me a reasonable explanation for this please?! I feel like canceling my account at this time but I would like my money back first. Thank you.UPDATE:I emailed Rebtel Support regarding this problem and I got their response within less than 24 hours. We were emailing back and forth regarding this issue. They asked me several questions and I answered them in details. On the same day (less than 24 hours), we figured out what's wrong: I had my iPhone set up with hidden caller ID that way Rebtel couldn't recognized my phone number (which is the account) when I was placing the calls. I did this setting a couple days ago when I was using my cellphone for work and I forgot to change back the setting.Having said that, problem solved and I think Rebtel Customer Support team were VERY responsive and really on top of it to get to the bottom of the problem I was experiencing.Not going to cancel my account.

A voice tells me that I may not use Rebtel for business calls and that I can call the numbers I called before, but not any new numbers. I don't know why they don't keep their promise of an umlimited plan, but this feels like I'm being scammed. Very unhappy about Rebtel.UPDATE: I got a very fast and kind reply by Rebtel, but unfortunately I don't know how to reply to their answer. So I'll try this way: if there is indeed a limit to the number of phone numbers you can call in one month, Rebtel cannot call the plan ""unlimited"" anymore. Your customers should know about this limitation upfront and you need to tell them how many numbers they have used and how many they have left. Transparency, please!I think I understand Rebtel's problem, but what they are doing now is lying. You cannot call a plan ""unlimited"" when it is  clearly not. Also, I don't think that I called more than 30 different numbers, which for me is normal use (not sure though how many calls I made exactly). How many numbers are allowed on your ""unlimited"" plan?",2017-07-03,12:39:49

First, my subscription got canceled for whatever reason. I emailed them about the matter and it's been weeks now and they haven't replied and said nothing! And since I really needed to call internationally and didn't have time to find another app I could use to make international calls, I had to buy the World credit wich only gave me 60 minutes for $10. But that didn't work out so well either  because when I would place a call, it redirected to other people's number where each time I would make a call it would go to different country, and I now this because they would speak a different language each time I made a call. So, I am very disappointed.",2017-07-01,20:01:29

562,Alexander David,1,The most fraudulent company you can find around!,"Updated review as at 09/07/17:- Further to my last review, Rebtel continued to drop my calls despite charging me for an unlimited minute. They keep using this call dropping technique so that I use less minutes, it's shameless and stupid company who has no understanding about the customer service.  Updated review as at 30/06/17:- Further to my review on 17/06/17, I hereby provide some new updates regarding the service i have been receiving from fraudulent co. Just to make it clear, I have took a subscription for an unlimited calls to Bangladesh for a monthly 9.99 pounds which Rebtel increased to 24.99 because they said I am using too many minutes (well thats why i have an unlimited subscription). Anyhow, I still carried on with the subscription despite their awful call quality and customer service.However, since 28/06/17, I could no longer make a call to bangladesh and they have blocked a number that I call!  When enquired, after complaining several times, they bombarded me with their robotic message, finally Mark Louie from customer service said,'Hello Mr..Tanks for contacting and patience in reaching us! The number has been flagged due to an abnormal use far above what is determined, as normal use, by our system! Calls to that number will be resumed in 7 days. Thanks for understanding!'- Now, I pay for an unlimited phone calls, mainly to one person. I pay a premium for this service 24.99/month. It's not Rebtel to determine how many mins I speak when I have an unlimited subscription for a very premium charge!- I would have stopped using service of this crook but I think these corporate thugs getting away with these malpractices with many other customer. So my mission is to push these criminals out of the telecommunication market!Updated review as at 17/06/17:-Further to my earlier review, I intent to provide some further update regarding the awful service Rebtel provide. I will shed lights on the call quality, call drops and feedback/help  I have received from Rebtel when complained about the service. -I used to have a subscription for unlimited calls to Bangladesh, however, Rebtel increased the monthly subscription from ¬£9.99 to ¬£20.99 when I provided negative review about the co and its awful service. - Despite the increase in monthly charge, I still use Rebtel, however every ten/fifteen minutes my calls are dropped, when I complain, they email me a robotic message which goes on to say ""Hi MR, My name is Sophie and I work with customer satisfaction at Rebtel. I noticed that you just rated your last call with 1 out of 5 stars on its quality. Something didn't work for you and I want to understand why. Not only because I want to fix any technical issues straight away, but more importantly because offering you the best call quality is my number 1 priority. So, help me understand what went wrong: Were you calling from home or on the go?Does it only happen when you call that specific number?If this was the first time the problem happened, what was different this time?I really want to solve the problem so anything you can tell me is a HUGE help and I really appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time :) /Sophie""Once you provide the info. nothing else happens!

Please DON'T GIVE A PENNY TO THIS FAKE COMPANY.Each time I report that I cannot make a call , I get an automated message saying ""please provide details of your call""once I provide the details I get no more reply. I have an unlimited account with Rebtel to call Bangladesh but I couldn't make any calls in the last two days. When I kept reporting the issues I no longer get a reply even.

We all should boycott you!You're saying you can't locate my account , my phone number is 00447878075930, I have lodged 20 complaints and one standard copied message and no solution! Because I lodged complaints from mobile there is no ticket number. However I am sure Rebtel can check how many I begged them to sort out my connection, AWFUL COMPANY, YOU SHOULD BE SHAMED FOR YOUR SERVICE !Updated on 23/05/17: Rebtel have deactivated my subscription after writing this review.

There are so many issues, including variable call quality, dropping calls but the biggest issue is  auto connections via a credit card, even when you cancel the card. I spent almost ¬£150  , when I would normally spend about ¬£40 just because they changed the system so that even though you have credits they take money via the phone when you dial, even if you cancel auto top up. The  staff 'investigate' but came back with woolly explainations that don't explain how the system has recently changed. Do not ever use your credit card wth these bandits, as even if you cancel they still retain your details and will charge you for connecting or making a call without any sensible reasoning.

674,Dhairya,1,Worst customer support,"They have the worst customer support. To find a way to get to them takes away all your patience. I am a new customer and trying to redeem a voucher. Also I closed my account with G3 telecom services to sign up with rebtel. I used 2 vouchers and none of them worked. I was without any telecom services for about a day and I had to call my parents in India. They provide expired codes to our company maybe so that people like us would sign up for an account and then bam! That is it, you don't get any credit against that voucher. I had to flip through the FAQs, read help articles and then they thought they had their fun so after 15 minutes of struggle the website gave me chat option. I still wasn't losing faith in them. I talked to an agent and he was rude and absurd. I even told him how important it was for me to make a call to India. He was totally helpless and I don't even think how to treat customers. He didn't even what I was talking about! When I thought he is not helping me out, I rated him 1 star and ended the conversation. He came back to me saying I was rude for giving him 1 star and that he was thinking of giving me some credit. That was unacceptable since I did not want to talk to him and ended the chat, he had no right to reopen the chat and send me messages. Also there is technically no way that you can end a chat except by closing out the website!!! I would suggest them to hire more polite reps and also train them to help us out better.",2017-02-06,13:44:52

Really? Who's f**king business is it with who I call? If it is a problem, why not go ahead and record the call or take some security measure, I have always used this service to make international calls so what has a business call to Serbia got to do with blocking my account and holding my call credit?

693,Anish Purushothaman,1,Big Lie.. Big Cheat..,Honestly I never had such a haunting experience with any service provider. I was told about Rebtel by my friend and I googled Rebtel Website. The welcome page says Unlimited Calls to India and Try One week free. I created an account on Nov 8th 2:25 PM hence I was eligible under free trial until Nov 15th. I decided to continue hence a payment of $10 was deducted from my card on 15th November. I made numerous calls from November 8th till yesterday to India but got a shock of my life when T-Mobile Service Provider sent me a hefty bill for all those calls. They told all those calls were made using their Network Towers. I emailed Rebtel Immediately since deliberately there is no customer care number given to call. Another shock I got when a customer care Representative told me that my free trial was expired on same day of activation i.e November 8th and it is reactivated on Nov 15 so now you can make calls. I told about my whole experience and the way he replied was very insensitive and unprofessional. If such is the start experience how can I trust you guys further if me or any of my known person want to use your services?Anish Purushothaman,2016-11-21,04:11:08

But what i found is , i could not  able to make call more than 8 TO 10 unique numbers .That means ! the numbers you are accesing are limited . if you try accessing more than this a voice message will inform you that ¬®you have crossed the limitation of unique numbers¬® . so it is clear that you cannot call more random numbers in an unlimited scheme but you can call unlimited to your limited numbers means numbers you used to talk frequently. And Rebtel did not mention this properly  when they advertising as ¬®Hijacking real phone lines to liberate international calling¬® or ¬®cheap as hell ¬® in their website .And their is no even any official customer contact or support for Rebtel. If you had to face any Real time  issues . You need to mail them about it  . i wonder why ? but may rebtel  still using 1 gen computers .Rebtel is just a shiityy cheat as hell like other cheap vendors like ringo !! instead of using this i just now shifted to lebara cards which they provide a separate sim , providing 5000 min under 5 euro .And freely accessible to unique numbers and also has a unlimited date validity .",2016-11-06,15:19:54

740,Nagaraja,5,Excellent Application,I am very much happy with Rebtel and it has been almost an year of using it without any regrets. I started using with unlimited calls plan to India then with the limited number of calls also. One good thing about Rebtel is call quality and accurate billing. I have used so many other applications where the call drop is more and quality is not good. One more good thing is after changing the new logo it truly deserves the caption of Hijacking the calls.Thanks Rebtel.,2016-08-25,18:07:03

The app dont work for intercepted calls,I used rebtel for yrs only to get an issue where I get charged for international calls and also being charged by rebtel when the app appears to intercept my calls.I have email tra\ils from this cowboy of company saying they wont refund my money. Despite showing them my phone bill and provided them with all the info they required.This company can also note from the charges made to my rebtel account that they charged me at the same time as my phone service provider charged me for the call. meaning I paid twice for the same call.They want to repeat several tests using me as a guinea pig without refunding ¬£130 of charges to my phone bill.I would strongly advise people not to use this cowboy of a company.I have emails to prove this and i will be forwarding this to the ombudsman.,2016-08-24,11:09:26

776,Raj,1,No value for customer concerns,"This company absolutely has no value for you as a customer. It is evident from the fact that they don't even have a customer care number. I have been using their service from few months. I recently found out that they have started charging me twice from last couple of months. Last month, I reached out to them asking why i was charged twice and they said, sorry, it was their system error and they cant refund, instead i can use their service for the amount they charged me. Which means I only wanted 30 days of service and they forced me 60 days service by charging twice. They also said, this won't repeat. I removed my credit card details and added a new credit card so that, they wont use my old credit card to charge twice again. Just found they have again charged me twice on the new credit card. I really don't know what to do with these guys . I mean they is a limit to which you can be so careless about customer service. It when a company starts acting like thugs extracting money without permission, you start thinking such companies dont have a right to exist.Response to your reply: I do not use facebook. Here is my ticket number #960798. I don't think you care. From the past three days, I am receiving the same response from you. which is "" the payment was made, sorry we can't refund but if you choose to use the service you are charged for you can"". I am planing to ask my bank to mark you as fraud because if I did't do it, you will charge me again next month twice without my permission and if that happens next month, I am filing a complaint with US Bureau  of Consumer Protection",2016-07-31,15:16:01
777,DroneD,1,Zero stars -- Scam,Avoid unless you enjoy being scammed!!!Would give zero stars if it was an option. Ordered $10 credit for 1000 minutes. First day I called and used 20 minutes it went to 980 mins. Second day I called the same number and for 20 minutes went from 980 to 718 minutes. Unless they changed the rate from 1c to 7c overnight there is no explanation. And just checked: It still @ 1c and use within one year for new customers. Once you sign and become a customer for one day the gimmicks begin.,2016-07-24,15:08:37

Even when I make a call while playing song, the app does't pause the song but my call is connected. You guys are limited the number of Phone number's to call per month, why? I have subscribed unlimited plan, but every month my called phone number's reached certain figure, they won't allow me to make a call to new numbers, why? you should not restrict me to call certain numbers only, if u do so, then don't call it is unlimited plan.. then what is the meaning of unlimited plan?Always i'm hearing ringing even the receiver end phone switched off or not reachable or busy and there is no feedback about that. pls improve that..",2016-07-19,00:41:59

There are so many other options out there. It might cost you a bit more, but you can stay out of future trouble.In my case, I could no longer to log in from my mobile app since they turned their logo upside down. It's been months. Thanks to Google, I was able to find out their well buried 'Report a Problem' button and send a few messages. At first, I received replies with staff's names listed in the end of the messages, though the replies are not for my issues, or just a product of 'copy and paste' in my opinion. As it went on, I could only receive automatic replies generated by system itself. As for now, I filled another web form days ago, no response, even from a machine, yet.Their new logo is shiny, so is their new website. However, if you dare look for their contact information, you are assured of disappointment. Except for a 'Report a problem' button, you will find nothing else. If you are lucky enough, you will receive their machine-generated replies, or nothing at all.You can smell it that the 'machine' is still running there, but the people who run it are absent.

835,Dinko,2,"Your account has been restricted - they restricted my private account, my account for business calls and several of my friends (I recomended Rebtel to them) also","My complaint is regarding Rebtel VOIP provider.Rebtel is a VOIP provider (they provide affordable calls to international numbers) with local access numbers.First you register (with your own telephone number from your country) for their service, buy a minimal credit of 5‚Ç¨ + EU tax, and then you enter an international number you wish to call, and Rebtel gives you an local number. When you call this local number that Rebtel gave you (you can only call it from your own number that you register with), Rebtel will connect you with an international number you wish to call.Like I said, first you need to register (enter it to Rebtel system via web interface) your own number (from wich you will be calling) and also that international number that you wish to call.Everything went well and everything was O.K. for first 100 minutes, which they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. Then Rebtel start to make this harassments and demands to tell them what is this number that I am calling (it was just one Estonian mobile number), to whom this number belongs, and why am I calling just and only this number (?!).Also they suspended my account (I can not make calls anymore, although I still have valid balance, and I paid for this service upfront), telling me that it is for my own protection. I do not understand why, as I registered all numbers in their system, and I paid for this service, therefor, I should call whoever I want. But Rebtel thinks that I should explain to them why am I calling this number, and who is the owner of this Estonian mobile number that I was calling! Outrageous!Also, I recomended several of my friends (because until now I was really satisfied with the quality of their service and price), and one of them got suspended also!When they suspend you, you got an automatic e-mail telling you that you are suspended, and you can not login, or make new calls even if you have balance and you paid for this service upfront. You have to write them and ask why they suspended you and why you can not use this service that you paid for, then you have to wait for their answer, and then this harrassment started.I believe that I did not done anything wrong, I registered and paid for this service, I was calling Estonian mobile number and they charged me per minute at their calling rate price. But, as I said, after 100 minutes they suspended my account and started to harassment me with these questions and asked me to provide them with some informations that was not their concern.I paid for the service, they charged me, and therefore, I should call whoever I want, even this is one Estonian number, without explaining myself to anyone. I did not done anything wrong. But no, they suspended my account and they started to harassment me.My friend has also the same problem. We selected Rebtel as they have the most affordable calling rates for Estonia, and they provided you with local number to call. So it was really affordable, and I would (and I did!) recommended Rebtel to anyone, but then this started.So I writting this complaint to let everyone know what did Rebtel done and what can you expect from Rebtel.",2016-07-04,00:25:03

840,Souren Kundu,1,Rebtel Charging customer's credit card without consent!,"Seems like Rebtel are engaged in an completely unfair business practice to dupe the customers.They don't give customers any option to enroll into any auto debit option during subscription renewal or take any consent from the customers to charge the linked credit cards. They charged my credit card 10 USD automatically without my consent and their customer support is saying it is by default enabled and I had to manually go inside and search from where that option is and disable the same during each subscription renewal!! They say as per their policy charged amount can not be disabled!! So policy also made to dupe customers. How come charging customers linked credit card be a default option without customer's consent..is it not grossly unfair and shabby?!After reading some similar experiences from other customers here, I got confirmed this is Rebtel's tricks to siphon out money from unsuspecting customers!!",2016-06-29,09:22:02

Turned over to AM EX to handle all.Signed up for service, started at $5.00 per month to Eastern Europe.  Fee changed to who knows what since they don't want to say.  Incurred 3 charges of $25 x 3 ($75) in 1 month .  Called AM EX to challenge the extra costs, Rebtel locked my service and said they wouldn't do anything until I ""undisputed"" the charges.  Customer non service service doesn't seem to understand English based on the nonsensical answers that does not address the issues, much less  provide customer service.

I call a lot and in fact use 600 minutes to call Nigeria  in less than a week but its so worth it because the call quality is super good, there are few glitches sometimes though but for an international call its not too bad. Also the call connects even if the other party's phone is switched off this is very bad And am taking a star out for that. It made me think my fianc√©e was quarrelling with me and won't pick up her phone whereas her phone was completely off because she couldn't charge he phone. Also my credit got deducted for those dials about 20min plus because I continued dialing and each dial lasted 2 mins each which really made me mad. well am over it now.

I have asked RebTel to clarify this matter for me and also either refund the second payment or advise me of an alternative. I've advised RebTel that if I don't get a response pertaining the payments I will be forced to contact my bank/credit provider and advise them to cancel the relevant payments!!I assured RebTel of my continued attention with relation to these matters but still have had NO RESPONSE!!!By the comments I have read here on TrustPilot it appears as though RebTel's reputation leaves a lot to be desired!!!It saddens me greatly to say this but  if you value your time and money then avoid this company at all costs!

I expended 260 mins and got a bill of more than $1000 from my network provider as rebtel was not covering the calls.

And they are not apologetic at all for this kind of scam. And if you go and check their website, whoever used this app once, became victim of overcharging. Moreover, they're being racist. This is what I personally noticed. As, they are ruling this app from US, bcoz they are charging us in U.s. $. If they see, you are either Indian, Pakistani (which one can easily recognize from our name), they'll never ever offer you refund for those fake payments and overpayments. Please be careful and if you still wanna use this app, keep an eye on ur account. If, m the only one, who hav this problem. Then I could b wrong. But there are so many people who have addressed this issue and Rebtel isn't resolving it. Worse and poor app. Basically, they are stealing ur money and account privacy.

892,Umrbek Allakulov,1,"Unresponsive service now, overcharged earlier","Update 12 Nov 2017Updating my earlier review by further downgrading it. I have allowed a week for Rebtel customer service to respond, during which period I made two attempts to get assistance.  The new problem: I have not been able to get any calls through. My contacts tell me that they have received no calls from me whatsoever. Meanwhile, Rebtel has been charging me for the time I spend on the line, while waiting - not talking. The complete unresponsiveness on the side of the customer service has convinced me I will stop using Rebtel after I run down my credit. Old update: after back-and-forth messages with the customer service - I should point out that they assigned a different agent per email - I have received a compensation. Mind you, this only came about after days of having to explain and pressurizing their customer service agents.When you order a $10 meal off of a menu in a restaurant, how much do you expect to pay for it when you ask for the bill? In normal state of affairs,  you'd pay the price listed in the menu. But the same logic does not apply to Rebtel's service, which I found out through a first-hand experience. I come from Uzbekistan, and was pleased to learn that I could stay in touch with my family as Rebtel seemingly offered a very attractive rate to call numbers in the country: 0.023 EUR per minute. However, after a few calls it came to my attention that I was running out of credit way too quickly. Upon reviewing my activity log, I was disturbed to learn that the company had charged me between 0.23 to 1.34 EUR per minute on different calls to the exact same numbers. That is 10 and 58 times the rate which is indicated on the app - 0.023 EUR/min - which also conveniently shows up before I made the each call.  I quote from the customer service response to my inquiry regarding this matter: ""I can assure you that we wanted to keep the same rates, but we were forced to increase them due to capacity issues and to be able to sustain the same level of quality.""Going back to the restaurant comparison: in a similar scenario to the one I am experiencing with Rebtel, you'd be paying anywhere between $100 to $580 for the $10 meal you had ordered. And you would find that out only after you had eaten the damn food. The server would kindly inform you that ""due to capacity issues"" the meal you just ate got much more expensive now - so deal with it. No restaurant would be allowed to continue conducting business in this fraudulent manner, and neither should any company. Avoid this service if you do not feel like dealing with multiple customer service agents just to get your money back.",2016-05-18,19:40:38

895,Nadia Johnson,1,Fraud - took money from my account without adding the minutes or email and restricted my account which is already loaded with minutes and have denied me access to my already loaded account.,"I have never been treated so badly by any service. I have been a customer with Rebtel for 6 years and never had cause to worry till April, 23rd 2010. They took money from my account (supposedly my monthly subscription charge) without an email or adding minutes to my account. I had a monthly subscription and it was all going well. I would get an email immediately it's gone through and also have the minutes loaded into my Rebtel account.My bank on the other hand has never alerted me of a fraud purchase but for this purchase they did. First thing I did before confirming it was a fraud was to check my inbox for an email and also my Rebtel account for the minutes purchased but to my bewilderment, there was no email sent, neither was there $15 worth minutes added to my account so I responded a ""no"" to my bank. It was a type yes or no answer if you recognize that purchase and an email or the purchased minutes in question, I didn't recognize that purchase.Rebtel went ahead to restrict my access to my account. I have not been able to use the $9 worth of minutes I already had in my account for almost two weeks.They clearly showed great detest stating that I should have notified them first before notifying my bank. I went to great lengths explaining to them that - this had never happened, - I didn't go to my bank, they reached out to me - I waited for hours to receive their email to confirm the payment,- I also asked them to check their records and see that I never got an email confirmation of my payment as is always the case.- I also said my minutes weren't added. They sent me emails insisting it was there. I have sent over 6 emails to them explaining but they have told me they will not give me access to my account unless I call my bank and admit the charge, get them to provide a written letter stating it was not a fraud and sent the letter to me. My entire friends and family who have also been in Rebtel for over 7 years are shocked.I have never been backmailed in my life and to think that I would betray my person considering also the services my bank provides me in protecting my account is just beyond me.Rebtel is basically punishing me for refusing to be blackmailed. After over 6 years of being on this service why would I jump up to create a dispute if they were no grounds? It was a clear fraud and I feel bad I have recommended them to all my family and friends in US and the UK? And for $15? I guess a smart way is to make me loose my $9 as well.Never leave your account details on file here if you want to keep enjoying this service.",2016-05-11,21:31:04
896,Esayas,1,The worst business ever,One of the worst customer service I ever had in my life ! I am not sure of this business is a scam or not but  I didn't get any kind of explanation reason for why I can't use the app anymore . I have my cc information in the app and I feel like I am expose to thieves and scammers ! I sent them a Facebook message I sent them through the general support nothing !,2016-05-07,16:48:47
897,Christopher Gooding,3,The On-site Customer Service link is poor. Better to sort things by messaging their Facebook page Rebel Help,I tried out Rebtel and was pleased with the result. I recommended the company to friends and family. All seems fine until there is a problem. On this occasion I credited my account using the  Paypal option. Rebel did not give me the credit - while I could see from Paypal that they had been paid. I contacted Rebel - they told me that they could not see any error on their part and asked for more details. I sent Rebel my Paypal receipt = no answer. I chased them up = no answer. I went to Paypal and filed a dispute. Rebel immediately suspended my account and sent me an automated message. I replied to Rebel = no answer.UPDATE - this was finally sorted. Rebel acknowledge that there was a problem the day I credited my account and have dealt with this. Further they say that they know the customer service bit of theurwebsite is poor and they are trying to improve. I continued to have problems communicating but finally used the Facebook route and things were sorted immediately.,2016-05-02,17:48:16
898,Dainius Lapienis,1,Do not use this service. False rates at the time of buying,"As mentioned in previous reviews this company seem to think it is OK to change their call pricing after you paid for their service and without any prior notification. After submitting a request for a refund I got a reply telling me that they are doing their best to keep the prices but are forced to increase them due to capacity issues and to be able to sustain the same level of quality. This the worst case of cheating the customer as the money is taken upfront and the terms are changed after. Is done so sneakily - without notifying the customer as well. The amount I have given these people is not much, but I feel disgusted by such enterprises which feel can do this and hide behind their T&Cs (which I am sure they have for this type of situation). I hope that this review will discourage people from using this service as there are plenty of alternatives. I will see what my options are in terms of consumer rights and will take this up with Google Play support.",2016-04-27,10:40:37
899,Skirtautas,1,Scam,"Hi folks,  please stay away from this company. I am a new rebtel client. Prices per min changing so quick and by huge difference on this platform. For example when I topped up by fiver on the day it showed my balance 200 min to one European country mobiles,  After three days showed only 8 min available. Price sky rocketing per min from 2,5c to 35c. Mad increased in price without any notification. I dont understand how this can happen??  This is  a joke or scam or what??? Also on the day i been offerd subscription unlimited calls for 7$per month to one european country. Now I dont see any subscription available particulary for that country at all. What I noticed  this crowd working so tricky and fools the people. They advertising and promoting product/service for one price, but at the end consumer gets absolutely different price. This matter  should be reported to consumer protection authorities this absolutely ilegal to act in the way they does. They should be sued for breaching consumer rights. My advice is  shop around for better service. THANKS",2016-04-26,08:07:44

905,Dube,1,Rude customer service,"Please do not use this service. I had used it Rebtel for at least 3 years now, successfully only to wake up to the worst case scenario and an even worse customer service platform. They posted on their Facebook page that they couldn't connect calls. Of course I haven't even opened my own Facebook profile in years, how would I know, so I make calls unknowingly that Rebtel is not working. Mind you, voice system says everything it says on any other normal day, ""Welcome to Rebel please enter the international number you want to call'"" etc. So I call, I have topped up my account with about 500 minutes so I'm not even worried. I make my usual calls, to all my relatives, friends unknowingly. The next day I find out that instead of charging my Rebtel account as was supposed to happen all the calls (now I know it was due to their connectivity issues) of course AT&T picked them all up and now I had a $400 bill. After five days of trying to contact them, I wind up having to contact them through Facebook, and they end up saying oh we don't see any of your calls on our logs, well of course if your system was actually down you aren't going to see anything. Then they say we'll give you $20 credit as a sign of good faith. $400, $20 , good faith? Come on now. And then they try hide behind the issue of not interfering with third parties, no this is about how your system fooled me. At this point it's not even about just the bill, the emotional toll all this has taken on me is included. My email is tequiladube@ yahoo.com for anyone who wants more evidence against these thieves, or just wants to see proof about the monster I'm advising against.",2016-04-21,14:39:23

I can use while operating my laptop or call while working on something else. This feature I guess help you to increase your business,2016-03-23,15:36:22

931,agomes,1,Unacceptable customer service,"I have been using Rebtel for more than 5 years now.  About call quality, price - I have absolutely no complaint.  It was a smooth experience, until sometime in January 2016, when all changed.  Rebtel changed their website ‚Äì for the worst possible experience for the customers.  I couldn‚Äôt access my account after successful login, and contacted the customer service on Feb 3rd of 2016. I received email from the support telling me how they can see I have logged in (after I have already mentioned that I could login and unable to access my account).  And then started emails every other day, suggesting me to try other browser, deleting cookies etc. ‚Äì one email ‚Äì one suggestion.  It took exactly 14 days for the issue to be fixed by their technical team.  Now the new saga ‚Äì can‚Äôt edit my local numbers or add any other.  I contacted the customer service again.  After several emails, when I mentioned I only 19 local numbers and I am allowed 20, I get this email that I have 20 ‚Äì now I have sent them screenshots.  I thought companies strive to get better ‚Äì never thought will find one that is trying and achieving to get worse by leaps and bounds until Rebtel.  This is a prime example of what a customer service should never be.",2016-03-22,18:06:36

951,Jennifer Clasen,3,Dropped calls to Cuba,"I downloaded Rebtel on my iPhone to call my boyfriend in Cuba. To be fair for the last three years I have been using google voice and Cuballama both of which have dropped calls, and sometimes it's almost impossible to hear eachother - as seems to be the case for most Cuban communications. I had high hopes having read the reviews on using Rebtel to call Cuba and getting crystal clear connections. So far: most of the time when I call it doesn't even ring on his end, and it eventually (1.5 min or more of ringing) it takes me to a message from Verizon (my carrier) saying the call couldn't be completed. Once in a while it connects perfectly and I can hear him very well - the best so far. He can not hear me as well, one time he got clear reception of my voice. My problem is the few times we have successfully connected, a few minutes into the conversation it drops the call and then I cannot get it to connect to him again no matter how many times I try to reconnect. It's so frustrating. I usually cannot get it to ring through to him again until the next day - and then again only once and only for about 10 minutes before it drops the call and won't reconnect. Like I said I had high hopes. ;(",2016-03-12,02:57:18
952,Jo Keyamo,3,Not a Happy Customer!!,"I have been using Rebtel for about two years now and to be honest, did this out of laziness on my part to find another provider but having spoken with a few friends now, done with Rebtel for following reasons:-1. Too Expensive: - in this day and age when there are apps for calling for free and clearly, there simply is no justification for such high prices for calls.2. Despite length of time using rebtel, you would think there would be special loyalty discounts to those of us who have used their services for such extended periods. In this day and age where every business is finding ways of rewarding customer loyalty and offering all sorts, it seems all Rebtel is about, is people using its services and loyalty does not factor into the equation. Why then should anyone want to continue with such an organization if benefits are one-sided!!",2016-03-11,13:59:07
953,Heidi De Jaeghere,1,My provieder in Belgium charged me for my calls to South Africa made via REBTEL,"My provider in Belgium (Telenet) have charged me for all the calls I have made via 2  deals to South AfricaI purchased via REBTEL.  Calls which should have cost me ‚Ç¨23,80 have now been charged to me for the amount of ‚Ç¨361,10. My provider have rejected my request for investigation that the calls were made via a REBTEL contact number as on the REBTEL  site. I have subsequently mailed Rebtel and am waiting for an answer.   I cannot believe this has happened and have requested they pay my provider (refund me) for the costs incurred.  Just getting my money back that I have paid via credit card to REBTEL is not an option as the purchase was made in good faith so that I could call cheaply to South Africa.   I hope there is a procedure for REBTEL  to take their full responsibility for this problem as they have reputable reviews which I checked at length before signing up for their service.  I advise that REBTEL remove deals from their website to avoid other people becoming victims of the same fate as it is for a reason we use REBTEL. NOT to be charged by our providers. January I used REBTEL via a contact number in Brussels to contact South Africa and my provider did not charge me.  February they charged me for every call made.  I sent 2 mails to REBTEL support last night with  proof of my bill from my provider clearly stating the number I called was the number given on the site as a the contact number for the country I was calling which was +27 87 550 23 47;  and will have to wait the 48 hours it will take to get an answer. I hope REBTEL contact my provider to sort this out as there is nowhere I can find a telephone number for customer service as everything has to be done by mail.  I hope and trust REBTEL will  solve this as it a very unpleasant experience. I have always had good response from Patricia at customer service.  In the meantime do not make any calls using a REBTEL contact number in your destination country.  Your provider will charge you full price.  Now is the time for me and for all of us  to really rate REBTEL on their customer service and solving this problem.   It is when things go wrong that the reviews really count.  I will keep everyone posted on progress in this matter.",2016-03-11,08:28:15

957,Mohammad Khan,3,Good voice quality with a few technical issues.,"Rebtel offers good quality calls with a nice mobile application and choice of subscriptions.  However, my main concerns using the service are as follows:1.  It only offers payments through credit cards, I don't feel comfortable sharing my card information.  Rebtel should offer more secure features like PayPal.2.  The calls are not the cheapest in the market (especially when you use Pay and Go without subscribing to a plan).3.  On a number of occasions I have noticed that although you hear the phone ringing on the other end, it actually doesn't start ringing before a number of rings i.e. there is a delay in connecting the call.Hope it helps.",2016-03-08,20:17:27

966,BHARGAVI,5,"Good, cheap, uninterrupted network and good service","Hi there,I had been using the Vonage service from United States to call my people in Asia-India and elsewhere, Australia or Dubai, Malaysia and Singapore though it was little expensive(every month charge will be fixed, 40-50$).However, I was disconnected from the network and I was looking for a cheap method to call India , from my cell phone itself. I had been seeing Rebtel ads but, I was initially apprehensive to use a new and unknown network and also was concerned about the reliability, money transactions etc. But, once I set up my account with the phone number, I found the ease of using it-U can set up local numbers for the international numbers you want to contact and also, dial in from the app whenever necessary, if u want to call any new no that is not stored.So, this is the first advantage. Secondly, they have quite a wide range of plans-depending on fixed and variable talk times. Also, the cost of using it is much reduced(for me, more than 3 times lesser) than the usual methods. If you use any other carrier /network like AT&T, I see their costs are always lil higher-about 5-10$ more for unlimited calls/mins.So, this way, these are the 2 main reasons, I would continue to use Rebtel for international calling, after my current 2 months usage.Also, I had an account registered on an earlier number which is not in service now. I was charged for the 2nd month cycle but, basically it was my mistake not to have deleted the account since, I forgot the pin. Later, one support representative has been kind enough to at least help me with deleting or not charging me for my old account. Only one thing, since, this company works out of Luxembourg, they delay a lil by a day or 2 while responding to ur customer service mails. But, they at least reply and are prompt in doing and trying to solve any issues.One more point is this service is available in UK, Dubai, Africa and other variety of places. They can may be expand their horizon.Good job. Happy customer...till now..!!! Congrats..and continue this way..Thanks",2016-03-06,21:22:18

I contacted customer service it's never ending conversation, there is no way to call them everything is through email and for every email they'll take 2 days to reply. When I reported this they said it was my fault. If it was my fault why would I contact them in the first place.

However, it is very disappointing that they will round off your time to the following minute.   You spoke 5 minutes and 1 second, and this will count as 6 minutes used.  Long distance fees are high enough as they are, I wish they would count the real time spent on the phone.  If one calls oftens, a couple of minutes can be lost that way.

You guys no where mentioned about How many phone numbers allowed to dail (I came to know 33 phone numbers only allowed from my Rebtel friend). if it crossed 33 phone numbers i mean 34 phone number automatic voice saying you are exceed call number for this month. in this case if anything urgent call to india? i am gone case.So i will look for another application depends on your reply.Thanksrameshreddy.emani$gmail.com+91-9686 597 354",2016-02-22,13:12:17

The practice of converting international numbers to local numbers made life really easy. Another point is the ability to recharge without breaking your discussion.  I have since recommended it for my wife.  In 2014 when my wife and I were in Texas we used Rebtel for the 5 months period of our stay.  Noe my wife is back to Massachusetts I made sure she continued with Rebtel.  i was pleasantly surprised that I can now use it in Congo and I have since registered and I am using it to call Nigeria.  Rebtel is convenient and affordable,2016-02-18,13:27:37

1125,nir,1,Something is wrong going on with Rebtel,"With the new app lost the ability to copy paste a whole number. The pre-set country dial code is irritating and requires too many clicks to change country destination calls whereas before I could just copy and paste a whole number including country code. Now with the preset country access if I paste it creates duplication of the first digits and requires more clicks to change to a different country. User interface was simpler to operate earlier I see no benefits in the new app. Customer service impossible to contact I had to go to discussion forum to find the email address and then took days to get a response that didn't answer my question, follow up was just ignored. New app not compatible with older versions of iOS. I'm a very early adopter of Rebtel but these changes makes me look at alternatives to be honest.",2016-02-18,13:16:55

1127,Fitih,2,A new price hike to Ethiopia! Beware!!!,"I was a loyal Rebtel customer for the past few years (about 4 years) and Rebtel has been a better choice for me. I even wrote an excellent review in the past concerning quality and great customer service compared to other services. The price has been an issue from the beginning until the recent outrageous hike made me update my review. Calling Ethiopia went from average 19 cents(US) up to 27 cents per minute. That is a difference of 8 cents per minute!! I was using a deal that allowed me to talk for 50 minutes with approximately $10. Now, $10 allows you to talk only for 34 minutes and that is 27 cents per minute. I have been sticking around after their price changes in the past ( partly due to the ""deals"") and the problem I had with my mobile carrier third party application issue but this time, I am leaving for good! A price hike like this is not acceptable and I will be posting this on social media so that other Ethiopians stop using this service. I know many people who are doing that already, thanks to free internet calls and more internet coverage to Ethiopia. Why should we pay this much in 2016? Bye Rebtel! I am cancelling my account as we speak. I will start by taking away my credit card information from my profile and try other services for this week. It is unfair.",2016-02-18,12:58:13

1130,Angelus,3,Good idea to get customer onboard,Your idea is great to get people on rebelsoth the new plan  but the only thing I find deceptive is that the recipient receives the call using data. Your unique proposition is that the call connects using a local number instead of data. But if the recipient can only receive the call with  data then your unique feature falls flat if their data connection is poor.,2016-02-18,12:44:08

If we go to dial pad, always our base country code appears, usually it happens for everyone to call a foreign country from the VOIP apps like rebtel, you can just leave it free formatted like earlier.Still the call getting disconnected during the call, abrupt cut.. That is really really very bad, sometimes it gets cut every 5 mins ...very irritating.Before it is ringing at the other party, why you issue to ring sound to the caller.You say unlimited calling in subscriptions, but there is some limit with in to call only few numbers unlimited. You say it is not for commercial purpose. Even for home use many ppl call many friends like me, why the hell then you say unlimited calling.To be frank, i am just sticking with you, just because you are cheapest at the moment, moment, someone reaches you, I wud be the first person to join them.",2016-02-18,12:33:50

1143,Angry_user,2,"Bad voice quality, and many other bad things","1. Voice quality is poor, probably less than 2khz (worst than pstn), to the extent that occasionaly i end up redialing directly to be able to understand.2. Masked destination ringing. When dialing a number, you do not hear destination ringing, you hear some rebtel ring until  the other end picks up the phone. That means you do not know if the phone is closed, or rang. I am interested to have normal phone call where i hear whatever i hear when calling from normal phone.3. clunky application. No easy way to use access numbers.4. now no sms.5. a dialer is not supposed to be a nuclear reactor. Dialer is a dialer. Something that you can type a number and press dial. With options to copy paste modify the number. I dont need your assistance on finding the country code, i know what i want to call, so you should remove this stupid list of countries. One you have an app that works, and no one is complaining, just stick with it. I do not understand why you feel obliged and urged to invent the weel every now and then. It is a dialer - not a supersonic aircraft.Avoid this app.",2016-02-16,18:47:07
1144,Alene,1,Horrible Customer Service,"I have been trying for weeks now to resolve an issue with Rebtel through emails. Normally what gets back to me are automatic generated responses, or responses in poor English with little resolution to the issues that I am having with my Rebtel account. If you are having any kind of issue with Rebtel, don't expect a prompt response or that you will be able to really talk with anyone about your issues. There is no customer service telephone number, and all of the responses about your issues will be slow. 4-5 days usually. I have had no other experience with Rebtel to make the think that it is different for anyone else. The most inconvenient part is that if you use Rebtel to make calls to Cuba like I do, that you can't talk with your friends or family until the issues are resolved because Rebtel unfortunatley is one of the few applications that will actually allow you to make calls to Cuba.That is the only reason I have tolerated their horrible and impersonal customer service.",2016-02-16,15:20:54

1146,Tioluwa,1,Texting service removed,The new Rebtel is awful and why remove the international texting feature? There are so many ways to make free calls that are better than Rebtel so I  mostly use it to make international texts. I just like the privacy of texts as opposed to anyone with your number being able to message you on a system like whatsapp. I added 10 dollars so i could text just realized I wasted my money. i am deleting the Rebtel app once I use up the 10 dollars and I have many friends planning to delete as well.,2016-02-13,17:38:35

Rebtel was calling wrong numbers!!!! This seriously never happened before, I have used it for 6 yrs! Try to fix this app please. PS. This happened ONLY with this upside down app I might have to look for sth else if this never gets revolved.Update 02/17/2016My account had $7+ and I talked for 15:25 min then it said I don't have any credits left to continue my call! I was supposed to talk for close to 30 min! I checked the price and it didn't change. Can some body answer my question? Also the quality of the call was bad, it was continously dropping.

Its not really ""unlimited""Why you call as unlimited if there are restrictions.There is no phone or chat support. If send email if you are lucky you get some response (not solution) in 4-5 days. The response by customer support person Gustavo ridiculous . Looks like he doesn't know to read English emails. Other reply also doesn't give solution for your problem.As you don't have phone support and need to wait for 24-28 hours for email response its really ridiculous not allowing to call even after full payment.  If you have limitation in the subscription why you say it as ""unlimited"" India call ? You don't ashamed to call limited call service as Unlimited. Cheating just because marketing purpose and make money in wrong way.May be all your unlimited plans are restricted to some level.After re-branding and new app and website your service become so poor.Please repay back if you not able to provide service and customer support.",2016-02-12,17:01:43
1149,Sathish P,1,Logo Replicate the Service,"Am not even ready to give a single star .. The trustpilot is not allowing to place the review with out a star.1 Star considering as BAD .. But the REBTEL service is even worst.I took the rebtel subscription on Last week of January, And they clearly mentioned about the pricing information for monthly subscription.Refer the rebtel website So I recharged with that amount, Just after 4 to 5 days got a voice mail saying that make another recharge with the same amount to make a call.I proceed recharge with that amount again though its not a month and send an email I got an acknowledgement but didn't response yet.And very unfortunate thing is they didn't even have a customer support number to make a call and the only way is you should wait and keep on recharge with that amount until they'll respond.We never know when they'll respond, Because there is no dead line date for that.This is the response I got from REBTEL two days before :Your request (#831676) has been received by our team. We answer most questions within 48 hours but it can take us longer during peak times or over holidays and weekends. If you are in a hurry, you may find an answer to your question in our Help Section: This is all about customer support !!!If you talk about the call quality that is Ridiculous..

1151,Duncan,1,Upside down logo - upside down everything!!,"I first started using Rebtel several years ago and it was a decent service. Now and again I had echo on the line but in general, not too bad. But then, oh my... why, oh why, oh why?!! The new branding with it's poorly designed interface is a total and utter disaster! First time I logged in I couldn't dial any of my local numbers because they weren't ready yet! What? So they change their logo and interface and roll it out although it won't work! Joke. I can't edit numbers, I can't add any numbers, if I delete numbers it won't allow me connect a new one.I've been in contact with Rebtel via email for the past 3 or 4 days and the issues are still not sorted. I've had brief 'brush-off' replies from Maribel, Zahid, Alexandra and Vilhelm, just stalling and not understanding the issue. Very poor. Like many on here, I also believe that unless they change it back immediately, we'll all be gone.And Wanda, no I was not given a ticket number as I contacted you via your website and since then via email. The original text (and subsequent title of each email) is: ""Where are my numbers? Why on earth would you roll out a new look which doesn't even work??!!!! All I want is to make calls, not see a new stupid interface!""Wanda - this is for you to copy and paste in your reply:-I am sorry you've been having problems [insert issue here]. We are doing all we can to [insert lie here]. You can be assured that we are [make up some crap and type it in here].No I would not recommend Rebtel to anyone.

1152,Piddo,1,REBTEL is now so messed up,"I am stunned with what Rebtel has done to itself. Everything has just gone wrong. Whoever decided on the upside down logo must have seen tis coming because everything about Rebtel is upside down. Now I am searching for an alternative after being a loyal customer for years. Can't add a new number until I delete an old one and when I select one to delete, it gives me my 50 or so numbers to choose from without a name next to it...like I am supposed to remember everyone's number. I then went back into the local numbers directory to see whose number I could delete to free up space only to find out the numbers have been wrongly allocated. Now Paul's number is showing up under Steve's name and Steve's number is now someone else's. My goodness, you couldn't make up the upside down LOGO. Perfect for the new crap called Rebtel.I then try to delete one of my old phone numbers assigned to the Rebtel account. Shows me 3 numbers. I try to delete phone number 3 and see that 2 was deleted. I then selected to delete phone 2 and saw it ask for confirmation if I wanted to delete phone 3. Oh Lord!!!I have also read a lot of reviews and it is just so annoying when they reply asking you to send them a private message on facebook. C'mon!! Get a regular email. Why assume everyone must have a facebook profil? I have been off facebook for 5 years so I guess there is no way for me to contact Rebtel. The image I have of Rebtel is that of a small company that's finally been exposed. You should never have changed the look and feel of the site. Ruined it all.",2016-02-09,13:50:01

It seems that the ""local numbers"" I had for international calls are gone. It tries to load forever, and nothing appears. Several emails for support bring no useful response except two that said the problem was fixed. This is a blatant lie. They should have learned that if it ain't broke don't fix it. Well, they ""fixed"" it so bad that it's broken. Disgusted!att: Wanda. As you requested, #829753 is one of my support tickets to Rebtel support. Hopefully you will actually fix the problem instead of having support people tell me 2 days later that the issue is fixed or working when it is not.

If I can't do what I seamlessly did before, then it's probably time to move on. I'm sure someone else does it better.I will be the first to say Rebtel's call quality  bar-none is one of the best in the business but if I can't add a new number to my account, I don't see the point in keeping my account. I'm sure having multiple number comes at a cost, but what about recycling old numbers? I hope someone reads this and fixes this problem before it's too late, I can see other reviewer complaining as well. And telling me to send a private message on facebook will not cut it. you should be aware of this problem by now, and you guys are not, then more power to you.The only reason I signed up for your service was for the ease of use.

1159,A. Agnelli,1,From fantastic to worse to worst,"In my opinion, Rebtel is an excellent example, how a great idea and innovation becomes a true disaster. I was probably one of the first international users of Rebtel and registered my numbers in 3 different countries. I found it fantastic and recommended it to many of my friends. As a result I received several credits and enjoyed sort of free calling for a while - until, suddenly, the credits got an expiration date! It's like taking an award away, but also taking my motivation away to recommend it to more friends. And while I don't really care, when Rebtel changes it's lovable logo to an aggressive red and upside down logo for no reason, I do care, when one of the most practical services - to use SMS - is taken away. This is not only absolutely ridiculous, but also unacceptable to change the rules for a service, that people might have signed up for, just to use the option of sending SMS, because it is (besides email) the best way to communicate with people in very different time zones.Some more bad news: When I tried to change some of my current ""local numbers"", they were DELETED, which also meant in some cases, that I lost these numbers completely. But when I tried to add those again, that I still had in my contacts with corrected info, the system tells me, that I ran out of local numbers and cannot add any additional ones.And don't you wonder, why there is not even a link on their webpages to contact any customer service? In the beginnings of Rebtel I was even in touch with one of their founders, Jonas Lindroth, now everybody is hiding in anonymity. I guess, their is a reason for that ...Maybe someone answers at least here to the following question: As I will not use Rebtel anymore, as soon as I cannot send SMS, how do I get my money back, that is currently on my 3 accounts (US, Europe, SouthEast-Asia)?P.S. I totally agree with all the other reviewers here, specifically with Raul Perez. The ""new"" Rebtel is a total disaster.",2016-02-07,13:07:55

I've been using your services for almost 6 years now and if you don't change I'm going to switch to another company. The main reason why I was with you guys was because you guys had the option to call somebody free by returning the call, now you are like any other company and even worst because your app is full of inconsistencies, bugs and it lacks of options, so it really doens't make any sense for me to keep using your services. Just in case you guys read this review the main things I can complain about is:1st and the most annoying, there's no place anywhere in the website or app where to contact customer service, my wife has a problem connecting and it just says ""something went wrong (what? who knows!) Please try again later or contact us (where?) if the problem persists"".2nd You guys are claiming that we can call for free to other people using the app without using wifi or internet but when I turn off wifi or mobile internet and I try to make a call to another person that has the app it says ""no internet connection to make this call"", so you are basically liars here.3rd. I sent a complain about the problems that I'm experiencing to the old support email that I have from you guys (I'm lucky I could find it in my old emails) and I just got an email saying that you guys received the complaint and I will be contacted as soon as possible, but 5 days have passed and I haven't had any luck by getting a response ticket number (#821300) in case you are interested. 4th. Your app is horrible now and your new look is horrible as well.and a list of the other complains so far: Where can I find the free call phone for each of my contacts?How can I know if the call I made or I received was a free call or a normal call?How can I see in the list of calls if it was an incoming call or outgoing one?I can't save my preferences after I click the button save, it says that my preferences were saved but I see the same options I had before. How can I change the number of a contact, it only let me change the name now?I'm thinking in going with other company as soon as I run out of credits seriously if you guys don't go back to the previous version you guys had before. It seems like Rebtel has a new owner or whatever but the new owner just doesn't know how to run the business. I mean you guys had millions of users and I bet each day you will lose more and more if you don't change that ""new version"".",2016-02-03,18:20:44

1170,Addey,1,Rebtel's new website,"I have been a rebtel user since 2010 and have enjoyed excellent world class service. Few days ago I attempted to log in and make some international calls and was surprised on not just the look and feel of the new website but also the functionality. I don't know if you guys have a Quality Assurance department or what they do there but the old website was professional, easy to use and navigate, the new one is a joke.!!!! From the look I could tell this would be a disaster. I couldn't log in easily, the password was overlapping with the text in the password field, I couldn't view my contacts as they are still working on the contacts directory (joke), I could still make calls though as I had a balance, but certainly once I exhaust the funds, I don't have I'll still want to top up unless the mess is sorted out. You guys have an app on Apple store and Google play, fyi not everyone uses an I phone or an android device, I'm just hugely disappointed and hope who ever just took over the realms of office reads this. You set such high standards and now this??? I'm looking into shopping around from this point. Good Luck. Ade",2016-01-31,23:07:49

Rebtel did NOT offer any credit or free call time as a concession for the poor service and disconnected calls.  Other international phone companies always did SOMETHING to make it up to me in the past.Service was ok for about a year.  Still not the best prices.  Then,  calls would be disconnected in about 10 seconds when calling a land line in Ukraine.  Mobile phones were ok.

When a technical issue the customer service always respond with a positive outcome. The ring tone is meaningless as does not indicate whether the receipient phone is busy offline ringing. etc. Quality of the calls is excellent. The best and cheapest app for phoning Cuba. Call counter timer only works with the WiFi mode so can be challenging knowing the exact duration of the call.

1285,William,3,Excellent until...,"I talk to overseas people, mostly in Africa, for almost 2,000 minutes a month. I used 'phone cards until I realised their published rates only applied for the first 4 minutes of each call--then rates sky-rocket! It is very sneaky, this detail is in the small print. You may think you are paying, say, 9p/minute but you are likely to be paying 20-30p/minute.So I was delighted to find Rebtel, which did not engage in this underhand practice. With no card number to enter, Rebtel was easier to use and the ability to allocate a UK number to frequently called overseas numbers was brilliant. With Rebtel calling abroad whilst driving became easy.After a few months of being very happy with Rebtel (call quality is generally better than calling cards too), I noticed the cost of calls to Zambia had suddenly tripled! No notification, nothing. Needless to say, I no longer use Rebtel.Rebtel is a very good service but check the rates charged and keep checking--don't get caught out as I did.",2015-12-15,11:11:09

1293,JI,4,Value of using rebtel,With rebtel you do not need to cut your calls to recharge because of the option to auto-recharge. This is good for business. Connections are prompt and clear. You have rebtel individual numbers you can use  from mobile and landlines.The only problem which is more recent is that your number turns up as unknown to receivers of your call or as a local un-recognised number. This means that you are not identified as caller and your calls can be ignored. Bad for business.,2015-12-15,10:38:23
1294,Mary,3,To much changing.,So when I first got the app it was great. Then one day they blocked my account for calling a London landline and held my credit hostage. I was told I can not call back that number if I wanted my account unblocked. Either way they ended up unblocking my account Witch was nice to use the service again because I do truly enjoy the app. But now calling the UK is four times the price as last month. And I think I am going to go to a more stable app. Either I am block for calling landlines or over night the prices go way up.,2015-12-15,10:29:17

1312,Tesfamariam Gebre,1,Worst audio quality. Use of illegal international call termination via internet and GSM Boxes,"Here is why I don't think Rebtel is using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation exclusively for terminating calls in Ethiopia. Two Scenarios1. Rebtel Call From USA to Ethiopia (terminated using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation)    * Call is good quality    * Phone in Ethiopia show caller Id of my USA number2. Rebtel Call From USA to Ethiopia (terminated NOT using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation)    * Call is bad quality(might even drop)    * Phone in Ethiopia show caller Id of local Ethiopian Mobile Number as if its a local callI believe this second scenario happens because call is terminated using internet so bypassing Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation and generating a local call using local Ethiopian Mobile Number to the destination number. Sometimes I even hear the exact unique 'your account is low' message (not the Rebtel message) used by  Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation as if I am calling from Ethiopian Mobile phone with low account.  The people I call in Ethiopia are confused to get a call from local Ethiopian Mobile number but talk to me (from USA).  My point is this second scenario does not happen if all Rebtel calls are terminated using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.The first thing I check when I place a call using Rebtel is ask the person I call if the number they get a call from is from my USA phone or local phone number. If it is my USA number, then great. If not and the caller Id is the local Ethiopian number, I am redialing again, because its bad quality and no use to continue with that call. I am clear that Rebtel uses different provider to route call. That is not the issue. The issue here is, which ever provider you choose should terminate calls using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.You have been giving me general answers and not addressing the issue (Scenario 2). Rebtel Calls are being terminated illegally in Ethiopia. But I am glad you recognize ""Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation"" is the only legal telecom provider in Ethiopia. Second Step is to weed out the providers that don't terminate calls using Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation.Thank you",2015-12-13,19:09:27

I recently purchased 10 dollars worth of calling time I talked for less than 30 minutes and my call was already cut and keep in mind that 5 dollars usually lasts for about 35minutes. I haven't heard anything from customer service. This is by far the most ridiculous calling company I have dealt with I thought their rates were good nope!!!

If you find such a behavior, Rebtel should cancel the subscription by asking the evidence not by terminating the account.. Many people bought the subscription in recent days and got terminated, how come there will be abnormal usage. And Rebtel is advertising like true unlimited, why so if not able to provide maximum usage.. Also many people had the credits in their account that also gone.. When we contact them , no proper answer for 2-3 days and finally giving default answer.. If you want to provide default answer then why are u waiting to reply after 2 days, u might have sent some auto reply with default message.. Full of disappointments.. Kindly do something to solve all of our problem by modifying the terms and conditions with limited usage, not saying unlimited.. Don't try to market it with larger amount of people..provide some meaningful solution instead of sending like contact support @rebtel.com",2015-11-23,21:11:43

I am using Rebtel for many years and I got incentives from you bcoz I spread the Rebtel to my family and friends.

1418,karen,1,Rebtel,"I have been using Rebtel for long long time. They do have good quality of phone quality when you talk and the price is cheap. However, my phone broke and I got a new phone, same phone number. I forgot my login and i got new login and i lost all of my account money .. it is $0. I sent 2 emails from my phone and i just sent another email while searching using my computer and that makes me mad because I said good things about them and referred my friend to join them!  No reply? I hope I post this out they will response, if not... maybe you should be aware and think twice before you put money into Rebtel.Finally got a response from them. here is what they said....Quote:-The credit on your account expires 12 months from the last account activity (SMS or call) so as long as you SMS or call at least once a year, your balance will always carry over.This is clearly written in our Website in Legal/Terms of serviceUnquote*************************************Well.. I didn't read the terms in detail but I guess I will never ever use Rebtel again.  I don't think this is a good practice. Even I didn't use for a year, still I put the money into your company.  Lucky I found out there are many phone apps now that enable you to talk on the phone overseas like ""Line"" is good to use it as phone talking. I love WeChat for text messaging, Line's phone quality is better but you can try both. The video & talk not very smooth I guess depends on both connection.Goodbye Rebtel.  That's all the money you will ever got from me :P",2015-10-06,20:11:40
1419,Shuva,3,Mixed Experience,"I have been Rebtel customer for long time. It is more than 3 years I have been a regular customer of Rebtel. Before last week I always had a good experience about their quality of service, both technical service and customer service. I have recommended rebtel to my family members and friends in the past.Recently I had a bad experience.The support was poor for the first time. I recently changed my phone number. Therefore, I requested to transfer my money from old number to new number. There was  partial money from reference bonus. Ms.  Laura was customer agent from Rebtel end. She said that bonus credit is not transferable. It was absolutely fine if that is the Rebtel policy. I did not know Rebtel policy. So, I made my request and as a customer agent her job was to explain me nicely what can be done or cannot be done based on Rebtel Policy. However, in stead of nicely explaining me, she started to blame me that I am abusing and misusing. The terms ""abuse"" and ""misuse"" were very insulting and objectionable, especially when it was baseless and with an old customer.  It was very unprofessional behavior of Ms. Laura from Rebtel end. Then she threatened me to block my account in future.  Her whole message was rude, non-sense and unprofessional. I expressed my dissatisfaction about her rude language in response email. She never asked apology for this rude behavior.In the past I had opportunity to communicate with Ms. Cintia and Ms. Alexandra,who are very nice and professional but Ms. Laura was unlike them from Rebtel. It was a bad experience.   It gave me the feelings that Rebtel does not care their customers.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Thank You so much for the reply. I feel much better to see your reply. I am not sure about the facebook page. So, i am replying here. The case number was Request #709001. Just to clarify once again, I have no complain about not transferring the bonus credit. I did not know Rebtel's policy about bonus credit.  I HAVE complain because she behaved rude with me by using terms ""abuse"", ""misuse"" and by saying ""she would block my account in future.""  That was an unacceptable treatment to a customer of more than 3 years old and who regularly use Rebtel by paying money every month.  The complain is about her behavior.Thank You once again.... :)",2015-09-30,13:45:44

So when I asked Rebtel to review my account for the past year, and refund my money for all the calls under 30 seconds, they replied back saying they only go back 30 days for refunds. So now when I ask for a refund for these charges it always take up to two weeks to get my refund, and usually they don't refund all the money they owe me.

I am using local call service provided by rebtel where i get a local number to call to india. I have been using this since last one month. On my mobile number i have free landline and mobile calls to any number in gerrmany. Rebtel gave a special number on which they charged me on every number that i called. I got a bill today of 136 euros for calling to india for which i used the plan from Rebtel. I have written them an email but no response. This is disgusting and ridiculous. I have never been charged from any international calling service that i have been using since years. This is the first time that i have been charged so much.,2015-09-10,10:28:18

I am not going to call in every countries on the earth, and I think same goes for majority of the people.

1465,VJ,3,Over good but some improvements required,"Call quality is good once connected , but i have few bad experiencesCons:- you get ring tone even if the other side phone is not available or engaged. usually you should get beep sound so you know the other side phone is not available, you don't try again.- if your balance is around 200 mins it won't allow two registered phones to make calls at the same time. It says "" there is another call going on..."" . I understand this as enforced to make sure running call has enough mins to finish. but 200+ is too high threshold it should be reduced to 30 mins or so.Pros:Good thing is it works on wifi, so you don't have to worry about poor signal or phone minutes.-Comparatively cheaper for that quality- You don't feel the lag in hearing the conversation",2015-08-31,11:18:33

They introduced ""Unlimited calling"" worth for 30 days to call India. It worked for a day. After that, I get a message ""Your account balance is too low. Please add more credit.""day 1) Raised a support ticketday 2) Support came back asking me to give an example.day 3) I gave them all the details that rebtel wanted.day 4) No responseday 5) Asked for a response again.day 5) Rebtel support responded (within 48 hours). Created a local number for the example I mentioned an day 3. Wait a minute, I gave a example as support asked. Nothing is working. Not the example alone. Icing on the top was, the local number they gave, did not work again. Same message, credit more money. They also told me that as a policy they will respond within 48 hours.on Day (5), I Responded to rebtel that their ""Local access number"" itself is not working. That is what I meant in day (1) report.day 6 and 7) No response. Where is their 48 hours policy to respond to customers?It has been well past 48 hours since i responded to rebtel support.I think this company rolls out products without testing. If the stuff works for you, good. If it does not, your are by yourself and you are in for a wild ride. Their support is extremely unhelpful. They try to pass the ball without taking accountability. I have easily spent many hours worth of effort fighting with something that should just work. Their support is miserable. Please let me know if there are choices that I can do.

1475,Oyekunle Muraina,1,Worst customer service of any company,"I have been using Rebtel for a long time. Lately I have been having problems. I bought the Nigeria big saver plan. Even though I may have credit on the saver plan I cannot make calls.  When I try to make call, the message I get is that I have no more credit. The last time this happened I bought additional credit but Still, I could not make a call.  This is very frustrating. The customer service is horrible, the worst of any company I have ever dealt with.  First of all there is no customer service telephone number where you can speak to an actual person. The only option is to leave a message.  When you get a response, it is to tell you that they will respond within 48 hours.  I should therefore wait until 48 hours to make a telephone call that could very well be an emergency?. I WILL GIVE THEM ZERO STARS.  They do not even deserve one star. How can a telephone company not have a telephone number for their customers to call.  I will never recommend Rebtel to any one. I will never use their service again until there is a customer service that actually works like a good company's.  THIS IS CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ITS WORST.Re: Response from RebtelI am not satisfied with your response. Why don't you have a customer service number that your customer can call for help?. A company that cares for its customer will be more sensitive to their concerns. You only confirmed what I said in my review that as a customer I cannot speak directly to a customer support staff who can help resolve a problem immediately. The only way to reach your customer support staff is through Email and the response can take up to 48 hours.

However, when I got home I found out I had paid over 130 Euros for 50 minutes of calling with the Rebtel app. How is this POSSIBLE?? I didnt see any warning, or notification that you are actually paying much more than it seems. I truly hope I can get my money back, which is why I am currently trying to reach out to the Rebtel company.",2015-07-11,14:39:18

The quality is good and reliable, but of recent I got an email from them that states that the price of calling Nigeria have increase, and the increase is due to the increase on Nigeria calls by telephone companies in Nigeria after the election. But I inquired from friends and families no one could confirm the so call increase in Nigeria calls. So I'm not sure if the reduced minutes from 270 mins to 140 mins for big saver have anything to do with the election.Therefore, if the rebtel have other information about the increase on incoming calls to Nigeria after the election I would like to know because I can't get anyone else to confirm the increase",2015-07-11,08:40:18

1506,David Ben-Gershon,1,Too bad - and getting worse!,"A while ago, after I made a post here on Trustpilot in regards to Rebel seemingly not honoring past commitments,   a rep from rebtel sent a response in which she asked to continue the exchange of messages on Facebook chat.I did so - and she claimed that They will consider a refund ""on my own cost"" - and immediately I asked how much will that ""cost"" be - and as soon as the question was posted, in the course of the live chat, the rep evaporated, and  totally ignored  the question, now over 24 hours have passed and I have posted ""reminders"" to no avail...They call THAT ""CUSTOMER SERVICE""?For such a level of service. I wonder if they deserve any customers at all...A reminder: when I signed up for Rebtel It was for a specific basket of services, for which I paid in advance.The basket ""shrunk"" - in other words Rebtel took the money and did NOT deliver on the services, and for a few years refuse to refund their ill-gotten-gains, and even the rep that contacted me did not have the honesty to answer a simple question!My advice: Use alternate app - and keep away from ""Rebtel""!",2015-06-11,08:08:16
1507,Mgborie U Udensi,1,Extremely horrible experience,"Rebtel is horrible. They charged my bank account without giving me the service i paid for and has vehemently refused to pay me back. I have sent countless of emails to their customer service, they replied me just once and after that, i didn't hear from them again. Of course i got emails to rate their service, which i told them was very unsatisfactory. Would anyone be kind enough to refer me to a long distance provider. I usually call Nigeria and the UK.I have no problem posting the email associated with the account. Im not sending anymore private messages, cos it's been useless these past months. So i suggest the team involved in such matters find my account associated with this email and get back to me. ThanksI also have the paper trail of the email that has been going between myself and your staffPS: I'VE STILL NOT RECEIVED MY REFUND OR CREDIT!!!!",2015-06-11,08:00:46
1508,David,3,Too bad...,"A few years ago I connected with Rebtel for the first time - and at first the service, prices and prompt replies to my questions made a lasting good impression: I needed an cross platform app that enabled cheap international calls using smart-phone and PC.For that reason I established a balance, intended principally to enable international calls from my PC.Very suddenly the PC call app was discontinued unilaterally by Rebtel. I inquired as soon as I found out (in 2013 in believe) and I was informed that reinstating a pc app ""is in the road-map"".Now we are in 2015 - and it seems that the ""Road-map"" is lost, and I requested reimbursement of my Rebtel balance and to my admonishment received a negative reply!The excuse was that PayPal does not allow a refund after more than 90 days! All I know is that paid Rebtel case for a specific service, the service I paid for was terminated ‚Äòtill an as yet unspecified date, and Rebtel refuse to reimburse me? The excuse that Paypal do not allow refund after more than 90 days is a lame excuse because PayPal certainly allows issuing a new payment - in this case from Rebtel to me for the unused balance of the account.What began as a very positive service - became something totally different..",2015-06-05,10:03:49

After a week time, I got the $5 refund but till now I did not get $14.9.

Now it is  more than $23 dollars.Defiantly need to improve the Fake Dial tone or ring tone. If I make a call it is keep ringing with a fake ring tone, until other side pick up the phone. I also use other phone service where I get real ring tone. with that I know how many time it was ring, If the phone is off, or out of network, or busy. Also if the receiver set a ring tone for me I can hear that too. But with Rebtel you are blind - until the other side pick up the phone and talk to you.Another thing is that, If you have a deal plan Rebtel does not tell you how many minutes do you have? or how many minutes left while you are calling.Most of my friends use Rebtel. People like me use Rebel to talk to their loved ones, who lived in overseas.

1779,Lena,1,This company steals your money!,"Use this company only if you don't mind your money stolen. I placed $50 on my account and used only about $10 of it. Several months later, my account balance was $0. They pocketed my money and will not refund the money back to me. Just beware when trusting your money to them. Also, not all calls go through and at times the connection is really poor. Another thing is that it takes them between 24-72 hours to post the money on your account so if you need to make an urgent call, you have to wait until the money is posted to the account to do so.",2014-10-14,11:28:32

I down loaded the app, and used my credit card to buy $4.90 or 100 minutes as stated on the website, but when I asked for a rate through the app, it said 17 cents per minute.  That is significantly higher and not acceptable!  I entered my credit card information twice, and it is still not showing my purchase of $4.90 (or possibly $9.80).  Rebtel, please show you are reputable and help me through this.  Thanks!",2014-10-03,22:03:27

But who deducts this them?I wrote to Rebtel to tell them about it, but then was explained that I am not on auto recharge and the bundle of minutes I bought manually was once off.... Did they read the mail....NO!!! I know what I buy. Then I wrote them a reply from the mail that they send to me, (the mail tell me to reply to that email address).... I've written 5 emails to the support service.... getting no response... in the meantime... another 5 transactions agains my account!!!!I am beyond myself. Rebtel has good pricing for where I am situated. But call are being dropped, phoning repeatedly to just finish the conversation. But their customer service is PATHETIC!!!MY ADVICE... NEVER TAKE THE RECHAREGE OPTION!!!",2014-09-25,10:20:54
1792,jak,1,They cheat with charges and sometimes call quality is unacceptable,"The worst issue is that some numbers (not all) they allocate are listed as LOCAL NUMBERS but when you dial them then on the next bill from your phone provider you find that they were NOT local numbers and you have to pay TWICE for the same call: normal rates to your provider and Rebtel rates to Rebtel. So much about ""special low rates"".And they charge in $US or Euro. You CAN NOT select $AUD, which means every time you re charge you pay via 'bad' exchange rate (I checked this) and on top of that you might be charged 'international processing fee' (which is my case was approx $1 for every $10 purchased). Sometimes call quality is so bad that I just had to hang up and try again the next day.I strongly NOT recommend Rebtel - try some other ones - when my credit is used up I will switch to another one.",2014-09-04,23:21:18
1793,Una Blogger,2,The CATCH or SCAM with RebTel‚Ä¶(?),"A long-time, one-time RebTel fan, I recently became aware of how RebTel offers such low rates: 1) your minutes start when the call/ringing begins ‚Äî not upon an actual connection, 2) it *simply* rings regardless of what is happening in the destination country (busy, error message, etc), and 3) I've even heard that after ringing constantly for over a minute (if left ringing it tries twice during a single call), the receiving party only got the last few rings(!). This is a real problem and questionable technique‚Ä¶ dare I say ""scam."" I'm already paying a local rate every time a call is initiated without connection using a local number during this erroneous ringing period ‚Äî why should we also pay an international FOR NO CONNECTION? Curious how many of you have been experiencing this, but did not know.",2014-08-20,16:10:59

1801,Alex,1,Rebtel and Privacy?! Quality?,"I am an living in the US, using Rebtel for more than 2 years.I got an email from Rebtel yesterday, congratulating the Islamic Eid after Ramadan!I was really shocked to see that Rebtel has categorized me as a Muslim and is spying on my contacts! This is a very big marketing mistake for them! Rebtel is a telecom. company, and should not in any way involves the religious belief of customers in their marketing strategy. Rebtel SHOULD NOT spy on my contact lists! I am looking to replace Rebtel with something else due to these facts:- Bridge of my privacy and categorizing me as a 6-cylinder Muslim while I have no religious affiliation.- The quality is very very BAD for the first time connections. You have to re-call to get a better quality. In this way, they can charge more minutes! - I am not sure if they sell consumers data to NSA etc etc! What if I go under the surveillance of NSA etc etc because you Rebtel guys put me in practicing Muslim lists. If Rebtel does not provide any satisfactory explanation for me, I will definitely go after them both legally and on the net. I warn everyone about these serious issues.------This is my response to Rebtel team's response:------------------ Dear Rebtel Team,Religion is a very sensitive issue! PLEASE DO NOT use it for marketing purposes! You should be aware that in those countries, there are a large group of minorities who are suffering from religious related discrimination and violations!Let me give you an example to make the case clear if it is hard for you to understand my point: - Your job is to connect people in the best way! Not to congratulate the birth day of Muhammed, Moses or Jesus, based on the stereotypes! What about sending an email to Neo-Nazis congratulating Hitler's birthday, and having some Holocaust survivors in the that mailing list, too! Are you guys sending a Merry Christmas message to Christian minorities in these Islamic countries. Of course not!In short, you guys should not be identifying your diverse body of customers based on their religions!!! That is like labeling people! In all of those countries you named there are tens of non-Islamic religions. I might have called some of those countries that you named but this is my business and NOT YOUR business to track my calling list and put me in your ""Muslim Box""! What if I call India another day: Am I a Hindu or Buddhist or Muslim or Christian or ...?!!! That is ridiculous! This is exactly what NSA programs are doing! Checking who is calling whom and how long and then label them! And they will be very pleased to know that you guys have reduced their work load with your religion boxes with the names of costumers!! Being at any points of the world, does not give you any immunity from NSA or other agencies! Are suggesting you guys have a better security than Google and Yahoo and Apple ;) By the way, are 100% of people in Sweden Christian and love Jesus and go to Church!? Of course not! So, that is non-sense to get religious messages involved in the business, specially cherry-picking for Muslims.",2014-07-29,12:16:22
1802,Tom Minney,4,Customer services just improved,"I was upset as I felt Rebtel had not informed me about rounding up all charges to next minute (so 50 minute package may only give say 45 minutes) and had ignored by emails and social media protests for 3 months. Last week (end July 2014) they finally improved, read my email, updated their Terms & Conditions to make the charges explicit, answered my emails and gave me a credit.

My story is below:_____________I (used to) buy between 2400 - 3000 minutes per month from Rebtel. So to say that I'm a loyal customer is an understatement. I typically buy the MaxSaver deals. This month Rebtel randomly locked my account. I contacted them right away and they did not respond for 3 days. The MaxSaver deals only last for 14 days. Hence I was unable to use my minutes for those 3 days (roughly 22% of the time given). I have ALWAYS exhausted the minutes in my MaxSaver deals. So this month I lost 285 minutes because they shut off my account. Rebtel refused to extend the deal but instead gave me 20 minutes as ""compensation"" for my inconvenience. I have an international startup and it was disrupted because of Rebtel. AND their solution: 20 minutes. I contacted customer service and their response was: _____________Thanks for contacting us!i totally understand your request but as stated before its not possible for me to extend the period of your deal since the deal no longer shows on your account.Every deal that expire, disappear totally from the users account.Best Regards,MartialCustomer Team____________Rebtel SHUT DOWN MY ACCOUNT for no reason so I wasn't able to use my minutes and then refused to either extend the deal for the 3 days they made the mistake, nor would they give me my minutes back.

1846,Debrah,5,Rebtel is excellent for international and local call. It is very fast and cheap,A friend of mine introduced me to rebtel few months ago and ever since I have stopped using phone cards to make international calls because rebtel is relatively cheaper and fast. You don't have to worry about the number for international call since rebtel connects you direct. It is also very reliable and connects you without fail. My desire is that rebtel network is advertised nationwide with their agencies all over the country because it seems to be very new anytime I introduce it to friends.,2014-03-05,08:31:14

1851,Bobby,4,very good w.r.t cheaper call rates,"Bought USA to India package, 2.4$ - 243 minutes(one month validity). Here is my feedback.Pros:1)Available in cheaper denomination so that you can try.2)android mobile app is user friendly and you needn't dial lot of codes to connect to a call. call gets connected just as simple as a normal local call.3)Login to your account to see remaining minutes, call history and call duration for every call that you made.

Sure, rebtel rates are fairly cheap but is it really worth it when both of us cannot make out what the other person is saying? We're constantly asking each other to repeat themselves because it's so muffled. We usually end our conversations more frustrated than anything because it's extremely annoying to have to repeat yourself over and over again. Also, there's a feature on the mobile app for collect SMS. Meaning the other person can text you and it will charge you. At least the SMS go through well, right? Well.. yes and no. I was ecstatic to find out that I can pay for her SMS sent to me because being in the Peace Corps, she's limited financially. I turned on the feature and let her know that she can text me freely because she does not have to pay for it. But did it charge me? Nope. Did it charge her? Yes.Rebtel has given me the worst emotional blue balls a phone service can possibly give to a person. Teasing me with the idea that I can talk to my significant other freely but turning around and slapping me in the face with horrible call quality and dysfunctional features.",2014-01-27,01:05:40

When my bank contacted Rebtel their response was to shut down my account and then had the audacity to tell me that I must inform my bank to release the hold. They then proceeded to tell me that it must have been a mistake from my bank. That was rubbish. I had been using Rebtel for approximately three to five years and spend approximately $200 to $500 per month on their services. My service was temporarily restored and after they were queried by my bank, they could not justify the charge the charge was reversed. Now they have Interrupted my account and shut it down. I am going to open a face book page and urge people to BOYCOTT REBTEL. I have been instrumental in getting many of my friends turned on to Rebtel. Now I am going to have to tell them about this experience. I had hitherto suspected that Rebtel was making fraudulent charges to my account without the corresponding credits being given and this time I caught them red handed.

T reconnect, I must hang up and redial again. All the Rebtel calls I have made have been to a cellphone in the Dominican Republic.

1954,„Çà„ÅÜ„ÅìÊÅã‰∫∫,1,"Unstable performance, very bad customer service, security concerns","I've lived in South & North America for some time; have had a chance to use Rebtel for 6 month or so. First, let me talk about their SMS service. It sucks! I'm not sure how the system selects on what phone number to assign an SMS icon, most of the time the icon does not appear next to the contact that was added, and an e-mail to the customer service has to be sent, and their reply which will take days to say ""we have received your e-mail"" and then another days to say, it has been fixed. Which I don't have time to wait for, all these in days?? Even when you sent an SMS, it gets delayed almost 90% of the time, and Rebtel always blames the 3rd world countries or the developing countries Telecommunication service, which I have hard time to believe when I can send an sms to 3 different people leaving in the same city/region and radius, only 1 will get the sms in minutes, while the others gets it in hours or even days later. Are you kidding me Rebtel???The phone service is acceptable considering, occasionally a network problem which can happen with all VIP phones; however whenever I added minutes almost all the time, I won't see my added minutes or balance for another 10-20 minutes, and that is a time I can't afford to lose, since most calls are made overseas and there are time zone concerns and etc...so timing is very important to me, which I never got from Rebtel till the end. I have had a handful of dropped calls while calling different parts of the world; I was given a credit for some, which is of course after complaining. Due to all my experiences,  I did not feel comfortable leaving my CC information saved there during that 6 month I was using.Now as I write this, my account has been blocked for unknown reason, it's still locked and I'm tired of going back and forth with their inconsistent customer service I was forced to abandon my account and look for other service elsewhere.",2013-07-24,17:22:36

The most annoying part is the scam like emails which they keep sending when your email them.such as ""our support is currently unavailable""or email us back in 2 days as we are adding new tools and improving our routines to offer a better Support! All together I have sent approximately 13 emails, in which I get such responses about how their ""Engineers"" are working round the clock. My $25.00 is yet to be posted to my account.

2093,Joep De Kraker,5,wow!,"It's so nice to get a number in Amsterdam for each person I want to call abroad. I can use my landline for that with unlimited calls to landlines in the Netherlands. I can also use my mobile with 800 minutes for landllines and mobile lines in the Netherlands for that. I don't have to be online after I have purchased credit for my Rebtel account. The fees for several countries are great. India is cheaper than ever. I used to have ‚Ç¨0,015 as the smallest fee and several times I paid ‚Ç¨0,02 to ‚Ç¨0,03/minute. Now only ‚Ç¨0,008 and only when the line is answered. Ghana and Mali have competetive prices. They can't still be cheap as ‚Ç¨0,07 would be. But they are just below ‚Ç¨0,15 and that's quite a standard price for other cheap ways of calling those countries. Rebtel has managed to keep their prices a little below that price of ‚Ç¨0,15 which I consider a great accomplishment.Uganda and Kenya and even Pakistan are relatively cheap at ‚Ç¨0,07 app. Very happy about that.Sending an sms must be done on the website. However you can type fast as you can use a normal keyboard which isn't possible on a handy. Sms's are cheap. I would have to pay ‚Ç¨0,55 for sending an sms to India with my mobile phone provider. Now with Rebtel it costs ‚Ç¨0,02. I also get to see when the sms is delivered. Great! I can see exactly how long it took for the sms to be delivered. I can also allow the other person to call me back or sms me back at my cost. Best of all: I don't have to pay incase the other person doesn't answer the phone. Incase I would use a cheap service number (0900 numbers) in the Netherlands for which I can call India for ‚Ç¨0,02 I would still have to pay for the 1 minute and 25 seconds I was trying to reach him. That is rounded to 2 minutes so it would cost me ‚Ç¨0,04 in total. If I would do that multiples times (as I have done at times) I am still spending a lot of money.On the downside: I can't let somebody call me back or sms me back for free incase they don't have a working internet connection on their mobile phone. They might not have a subscription for internet or their bundle might have finished or they might not have purchased internet as they might not have enough money for that. In all of these cases they can't just simply call me back at my cost. That's different with a Collect Call. An operator will ask permission and will connect the other person to me at my cost. It is expensive of course but it works. Now however people can only respond incase they can access the internet. It would have been nice if the system recognizes that I have used Rebtel for sending the sms or for calling them so that the system automatically will deduct the collect call fees for a call or sms of my Rebtel account.Keep going!",2013-02-13,11:06:31

2101,Jessica Hinojosa,3,"Mainly great service, but some sneaky charges turned me off","I was excited by Rebtel when it was first recommended to me by a friend, and I've used it several times with success. However, in a recent experience, I called someone, they didn't answer, but then they called back using the Rebtel numbers, and unknowingly I somehow ""accepted"" a collect call. Because I believed the rate to be 1.5 cents per minute, I talked for 30 minutes, only to find my account charged for close to $9. Apparently a small noise made at the beginning of my call was supposed to alert me that I was getting charged at this absurdly high rate. I think it's abusive of Rebtel to believe anyone could figure that out. I promptly went into my settings and changed my alert for receiving collect calls - I suggest all other users do the same. But I am now much more hesitant to use Rebtel due to fear of other hidden charges.",2013-02-06,21:22:11

Also you can assign local numbers such as 020, 0121, 0114 etc numbers, so when you call that number the call gets directed to the international number, saving you lots of money.I'm very happy with the service and will continue to use this unless someone else comes along and offers rates around 0.01p, which I very much doubt for now.",2012-12-05,11:42:39

Then my phone lost battery, so the call was terminated, and I called again. Same as the 1st call - my mother did not hear me - another 7 cents for nothing. I called back and it worked okay for a while, but my balance was getting low, so I added funds ($10) during the call. Guess what? The call was ended by Rebtel when the balance dropped to $10.03. Yes, there were beeps and notifications, and also automated operator was asking me to add funds. I already added funds online, so I did not add more funds on the phone. I switched from Google Voice due to the fact I had to close my Google accout. Rebtel calls worked better at the same rate of 2 cents a minute as Google Voice, before the rate went up to 7 cents.

I think the ubiquitous collecting of data by suc services as Google, Microsoft, Facebook and now Rebtel  should be of great cocern to everyone but most do not think about the consequences.  I do nd am not prepared to give up control of my personal data to anyone un-necessarily.  I have paid to use this service and as far as I am concerned Rebtel should only require the information needed to administer the account and payment,  I wish to continues to use this service but I will only consider using Rebtel's web page based services.

With Rebtel, Bingo!!However I am thinking if it could be possible to have just a pre code replacing the local number followed by the number one wishes to dial. This way, one does not even have to go through the operator. Using a cell phone, you cannot dial from your contacts menu when the operator comes on. The number you wish to call has to be copied in writing from your contacts menu, then quickly upload the dialing pad to dial the number. Can there be a solution ?",2012-09-13,03:14:39

2418,Jonathan Amos,4,Comparatively excellent service but not cost effective.,"REBTEL renders an excellent service, but the reason why I did not rate them 5-star is that, most of their rates are not cost effective. Other competitors are offering much more reasonably lower rates with the same type of services. The reason why I am still hooked to REBTEL is that, I don't want to share my credit card information with so many guys up there. At least REBTEL have been faithful to me, so I would want to continue with them rather than changing services at random. All I want to say is that, they should look at the market trend and bring to their customers services/rates that they deserve.",2012-06-06,11:56:14

2420,Safari Nyumbani,5,Rebtel rates are the best I have had for my 28 years of residing in U.S.,"I previously paid an average of $150.00 per month to call Kenya and spoke on a limited basis using: verizon, t-mobile, or virgin mobile.  But since discovering rebtel's rates 2 months ago, I have spent $25.00 per month calling Kenya from US and speaks more than enough with my family.   Rebtel is a family- oriented company.   Rebtel is a winner.  Rebtel rocks!  Keep up premier customer service!  Keep up excellent rates!  You are the best rebtel! Unbelievable.",2012-06-06,02:12:47

2427,Zoltan,4,Cheap and reliable,"Almost perfect. I'm really satisfied with the company and their program what I can use for calling from my PC. It gives great quality during calls, sms possibility. The company also gives a local phone number I could call which redirects my calls (after authentication) to that direction I set up before. Not to mention Rebtel prizes are really cheap for some direction what I use on regular basis. I could imagine cheaper prizes for some direction (e.g.: Hungary), adding friend to contact list on PC seems not always works perfectly, missing video call option in case you want to use PC-PC call, no possibility to follow up my balance during the call (calling from PC application), what could be really annoying in case I would be close to my limit.Rebtel website also should make some reorganisation on main page, before joining it was really hard to find calling rates, but that should be on focus every time to find it easy. It is really positive they show how many minutes you could get by $10, but would be great to see even my available balance how much minutes worth to different directions.All in one: I recommend them, I'm happy to be their customer but would be happy to see some  more improvement from Rebtel.",2012-05-24,11:32:05

It doesn't make it impossible to communicate but there is a room to improve for sure... Also the""1- 800"" alike free calls should be available to make Rebtel an all around service...  Managing and analyzing everything from my credits to calls I made is pretty good and easy. Being able to receive collect calls is pretty flexible. And the assigned 7 digits local numbers corresponding to my international numbers makes the process very pleasant and swift. To be able to use these facilities with multiple phone numbers is very nice as well...And I certainly appreciate the quality of responds that arrives eventually :)Although one would say that a potentially renowned telephone company should have  A Customer phone number available to desperately help seeking customers... Even though as terrifying as it sounds! I'm looking forward to get some complementary bonus rounds introducing your company...  Keep up the good work..PS. I realize that my review sounds a bit promotional and I must apologize for that..

I needed sth cheap to stay in touch with my friends and family in Poland. However I found out the hard way that rebtel  fees and rates are not as clear as company want us to believe in. For example when you top up credit they charge extra tax to it. So for example a 20‚Ç¨ credit actually costs you 23‚Ç¨. But it's not all. According to the rebtel website a single minute to polish mobile phone should cost me 0,119‚Ç¨ but after a brief chat with my sister ( around 4 min) 1,5‚Ç¨ disappeared from my account.

2605,The Pedro DB,4,Still Good But Now Much More Expensive..,"I joined RebTel 8 months ago and have been delighted with the ability to make cheaper international calls.  The service level/call quality is consistently good.  I have never had a call dropped or got cut-off as a result of service disruption.  In the main, it's all good.However, two things really gall me about RebTel;1) Why was it necessary to recently increase your call prices so much?  The majority of my calls are to Thailand and you raised the cost/minute by almost 300% !!!  Why was that necesssary RebTel?  Are you getting a bit greedy?  I suspect that your ISP has not raised your costs at anything like that percentage, if at all....2) Why should customers have to Pay VAT on call credit?  I have used similar telephony based VOIP services before and not been charged VAT.",2012-01-20,08:42:11

2620,Very Unhappy and $50 a$$ed out,1,Not satisfied,"This is the worst garbage i have ever used.  The boast cheap calling price, but when i got my phone plan back i was charged by my phone company for using REBTEL's ""loca"" numbers.  I ended paying rebtel and the phone company so it was more expensive.  Rebtel does not make it their point to make sure the customers have all the information before use.  After this happened i went back to the rebtel website and after almost an hour of looking on their website i found out that landlines also get charged by their local phone company.  This needs to be in bold and a lot more clear and visible.  i dont recommend this company.",2012-01-06,06:17:11

I get an extra 10 mins and I save on tax money by not going to the store to buy phone cards. Save mins, save tax money, and the trip to the store to buy the phone card. All you need is a debit or credit card, and purchase the card of your choice. My preference is the $10.",2012-01-02,17:46:11

2647,Jeff,4,Good service but not the cheapest,"After signing up I soon found another service that offers cheaper rates. This is primarily due to certain host-carrier rates differing.

To ensure, i try same number from same location to same receiver at same time from another service provider, and found that every thing was Good. This has beed repeated again and again with me at different time, and different dates and different receivers. So i feel that you make good impretion at initial stage, and once you feel that user is in your trap, you start cheating. This is modren world, i need to call and i wish to have best value for my money. you can take away what i had paid but sure you will loose me.

Both times, I was unable to use the service or even log in to my online account.  When this happens, you must email them and wait for a reply.  There is no customer service number, email is the only method of communication.  In both cases, I was locked out due to a specific number they claimed I called.  I was told that number was in a block of numbers that they claim have been perpetrators of fraud on their service.  I have never called the number they claimed I called.  Hopefully their automatic fraud detection system will improve, as it is obviously quite buggy.  I'm sure they could have handled this better as well.  Other than that, the price is right and I haven't noticed any issues with the call quality.

2706,Luis,5,Excellent!,"I learned of Rebtel when looking for lower long distance rates when calling my relatives in Cuba from the U.S. $0.79 per minute through Rebtel may seem high, but it is actually the best deal around! Besides, the convenience of having a local number to dial from a regular telephone is a godsend for my mother.Perfect sound quality, ease of use, no small print, no extra charges... A winner!",2011-12-27,19:41:59

2708,Tony,3,So and so...,"Been using Rebtel since november, first weeks it was quite ok - but lately i experienced a drop in quality, they tried to fix it twice for me so I hope it will improve. Calling Sweden to Cambodia 6 cent/minute is nice if only the quality will be a litle better....",2011-12-27,19:26:37
2709,Scott,1,Can't sent message since Adnroid update,"Since the new update for Android I can't send international messages. The rebtel app puts in my country code before the number that I'm sending the SMS. There is no way round it because it doesn't give the opportunity to edit the number. Just an error message that the SMS can't be sent to that country (I'm sending to the UK). I've been in touch with Rebtel almost 1 1/2 weeks ago, and I've had no reply from them. Not happy with the new update and not happy with the customer service.",2011-12-27,19:25:48
2710,Jessica,5,get to call deployed husband,"Our cell phone provider wanted to charge us up to $2.99 a minute!  With a simple download of Rebtel on my iPhone, I now call my husband on his international cell phone for $.26 a minute!  You can't beat that!  Plus when I have little or not signal, I can call him via 3G/Internet!!  The connection is always great! Plus I can send SMS!  I have recommended this app to all of my army friends!!!",2011-12-27,19:22:36

2714,Tim,3,"Ok, but!","U need improve SMS, possibly include its cost on ur bills. I observed every message through ur network don't get delivered.",2011-12-27,19:16:53
2715,Alicia,5,Rebtel is great! I really like the local number feature that makes calling easy.,"The assignment of a local number is a great idea.  My area doesn't support avoiding long distance charges, but it makes it easy and simpler to dial an international number.  And if someone else sees the number, it hides the fact that it is international in case that matters.  Also, I don't feel as if I am calling so far away.  The Rebtel costs are reasonable or even lower that most.  I use Paypal to quickly add funds to my account.",2011-12-27,19:14:10

As a personal experience, i have been able to call my home country anytime and with a very respectful quality. I am now recommending the service to my friends abroad and do not hesitate using the share with friends feature to get more credit to call for free! Plus, they have just released an application for computer that ive been trying and works perfectly. Simple and handy, very rebtel!",2011-10-10,14:05:36

2725,TGSE,5,Rebtel saves me a lot of money,"My bills were running high so I decided to give Rebtel a try and I regret I waited so long!

It's really simple to install and handle which is perfect for me who aren't very tech-savvy :)",2011-09-13,07:43:33
2726,Verona,5,"Cheap calls in every ""home""","I signed up for Rebtel 3 years ago, when I moved to the Netherlands for my Master studies. As a student, you don't get much money to spend, so Rebtel was a great way to save on calls to my family.After I was done with my studies, I got a job in London and moved there shortly after. And guess what? I could still use the same Rebtel account, with my saved contacts and history, with my new sim card.The service is awesomely convenient! Easy to take with you to any country, easy to use and of course cheap to call wherever you need to call.Highly recommended!P.S. Android app is awesome. Highly recommended too!",2011-09-12,18:35:17

2730,Malta girl,4,Rebtel user in Malta - works great!,"I moved recently to Malta and the money I spend on talking on a phone has increased. I happen to be a person who wants to talk with the family and friends back in Scandinavia when I feel like speaking to them, without planning a Skype date. The con with this is the high usage off pre paid to pup cards.. My friend suggested me to try out Rebtel. I love it! I can call more often abroad without higher cost than doing local calls. My user experience has been generally very good and I can recommend it to the people who want to stay in touch with people living in another country. Thank you Rebtel!!",2011-08-23,10:53:18
2731,Asya Oskolkova,5,Rebtel is doing great everywhere,"I decided to try Rebtel service mainly to see if it could help those friends and relatives who are non-techie, and it did. Some phone services have hi-fi methods/plans which may be tough to implement by the common man.But Rebtel is simple, cheap and seems to be way better than conventional calling methods. Here the phone bell rings immediately as you dial the number, unlike other phone services which I have tried in this past. Though they charge a minimal price, yet the Call quality has been excellent so far.After I got accustomed to this service and was satisfied about the same, I encouraged my loved ones to register with Rebtel. My family in abroad has been using this since a year and even my relatives and friends who are dispersed across the globe. All of them are thankful to me for recommending Rebtel.The company offers you very reasonable international calls rates to various locations by assigning specific local phone numbers to your calls recipients in their countries. Rebtel also offers you the benefit of several freebies. You can call your friend and ask him to hang up for some time, and call you back while you stay on the line. You'll be connected and you get the ‚Äòfree‚Äô call advantage of the international part. It may sound weird but trust me it works.Also, you get a trial 5-minutes phone call to any number and not to forget all calls between Rebtel members are free. However, to enjoy this freebie, your friend may not necessary be a Rebtel subscriber at all but both of you must be living in one of the 51 Rebtel countries.",2011-08-23,10:12:56
2732,allan,4,Thats Why I Love Using Rebtel,"For the next 36 months, my wife has been transferred to Manchester, UK. We have 2 kids, our son who is 8 years old and elder daughter who is 12 years old. Both the kids are very responsible and manage their activities on their own. We have tried several cheap international calling facilities, but none of them had good voice clarity, and surprisingly none of them turned out to be cheap as promised.Our neighbours recommended Rebtel. They had a lot to say about Rebtel and its cheap international calling plans. They were quite convincing and we too tried Rebtel. As a starter we got 5 minutes of free calling and since it was Easter week the call rates were further low than their normal rates. Our kids love this service and believe me the voice clarity is very good. Not to forget, Rebtel to Rebtel calling is free, so most of the times we are actually speaking free, unless we have to call some other number. Recently I got an e-newsletter from Rebtel, they serve more than 51 countries and every week they have some special offer.Its good to know how technology can help you save money. Thank you Rebtel.Pros - Cheap Rates, Good Service, Great Voice ClarityCons - Call drops on few occasions.",2011-06-29,14:40:22
2733,Amry,5,"Rebtel, a well-programmed service","As a manufacturer in New York, I make several calls to Europe since my business runs there too.I use my mobile phone so much that I just can‚Äôt have the count of it but that hardly matters sinceRebtel gives me an affordable service.The functionality of Rebtel is really simple. My contact list is programmed into my phone andeach one has a unique phone number, and it‚Äôs great to ask the other person to call. This serviceisn‚Äôt expensive and the rates are way better than calling cards. The quality of each call brings asmile to me.Initially Rebtel sounded a little strange to request the other party to call back but later on itbecame a routine. It‚Äôs so cool! I make a call to someone and he says shall I call you back? Iwould suggest, if it‚Äôs going to be short calls then don‚Äôt ask for a call back, since the rates are wayaffordable.Let me not forget to mention about quality, since I am frequent international caller I tried severalcalling card which used to charge me a heavy price. Not only that, even the quality of the eachcall was way bad and the wait time for the ring was too long. The service would cause painrather than comfort. I used to get cut off so often that would disturb my business conversation.With Rebtel the call quality is crystal clear and it starts ringing right away.So if you want to save your money and make life easy, Go for Rebtel!Good: Ease to execute and great call qualityBad: None",2011-06-01,11:42:23
2734,Jens Olsson,4,Easy to use and cheap,"I use Rebtel to call two of my best friends who lives in Rio and Oslo. I use the Android app, and it's so easy to use you almost can't believe it. When you dial an international number you get a question if you want to use Rebtel, you click yes, and the call is forwarded through Rebtel, that's it!I was a bit hesitant to switch from Skype to Rebtel since the service looks a bit complicated on the home page. But I'm really happy that I decided to use Rebtel instead. I call from my own cell phone and pay almost nothing.I think Rebtel would get a lot more customers if people really understood how easy the service is to use.",2011-05-13,09:15:20
2735,Kisty Schmidt,5,International calls at cost of local calls,"I'm a single mother from Newyork and currently my son is doing research in South Africa. The cost of international calls is too high, because of which we barely spoke once in 10 days.Few months back one of my son's colleagues suggested Rebtel to make cheap international calls. My son explained to me the concept of Rebtel which is based on internet telephony and why the calls made using Rebtel are cheap. Both of us have local Rebtel numbers on which we make a call, which gets internationally connected and that's how we speak to each other, every third day. And it is super easy to use. I don't have to worry about the bill s I can make payment through my credit card.I would sincerely recommend their customer support for guiding me through the entire process. Since my son is always busy on field, I take help from Rebtel customer support. The support system is apt and easily understandable by someone like me who is not technology friendly. I have even suggested Rebtel to my sister living in downtown Chicago.I just have one suggestion, please post me newsletters or other offers since I don't use the internet often.Thank you Rebtel !!",2011-05-06,10:14:25
2736,Daniel Carlsson,5,Awesome cheap international calls,"I've been using Rebtel for about a year to stay in touch with my friends and girlfriend abroad.

2737,Peter B√§ckstr√∂m,4,Good reliable service,"I think Rebtel is a good and reliable service for making international phone calls. I use it a lot to talk to my friends in Germany. Sure, there are other ways that might be cheaper/free but the ease of use and the quality totaly make up for the small fee I have to pay. //P",2011-04-15,13:10:24
